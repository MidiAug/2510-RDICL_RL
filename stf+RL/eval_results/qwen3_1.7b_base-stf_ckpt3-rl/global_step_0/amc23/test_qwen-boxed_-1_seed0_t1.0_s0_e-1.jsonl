In any one jump, independent of previous jumps, Flora leaps a positive integer distance $m$ with probability $\\frac{1}{2^m}$.\nWhat is the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10? Write the answer as a simplified fraction $\\frac{m}{n}$, find $m+n$", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "3", "answer": 3.0, "code": ["To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that Flora will eventually land at 10 after a sequence of right jumps from 0. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Probability Distribution:**\n   - Flora jumps a distance \\( m \\) with probability \\( \\frac{1}{2^m} \\).\n   - The sum of all probabilities must be 1:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^m} = 1\n     \\]\n   - This is a geometric series which sums to 1.\n\n2. **Event of Landing at 10:**\n   - For Flora to land exactly at 10, she must land at specific positions: 0, 1, 2, ..., up to 9.\n   - If she lands at 10, she did not land at any previous position (0, 1, 2, ..., 9).\n\n3. **Probability Calculation:**\n   - Consider the event that Flora does not land at any position from 0 to 9. This means she must jump a distance that allows her to reach 10 without landing at any of these positions.\n   - Let’s denote the event that Flora does not land at any position from 0 to 9 as \\( E \\).\n   - We need to find \\( P(E) \\).\n\n4. **Using Complementary Probability:**\n   - The complementary event is that Flora does land at any position from 0 to 9.\n   - Therefore, \\( P(E) = 1 - P(\\text{not landing at } 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 9) \\).\n   - We need to find \\( P(\\text{not landing at } 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 9) \\).\n\n5. **Detailed Calculation:**\n   - We need to sum the probabilities of not landing at each position from 0 to 9.\n   - For example, the probability of not landing at 0:\n     \\[\n     P(\\text{not landing at 0}) = 1 - \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right)\n     \\]\n   - For position 1, the probability of not landing there:\n     \\[\n     P(\\text{not landing at 1}) = 1 - \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) = 1 - \\frac{1}{4}\n     \\]\n   - Continuing this process for each position from 0 to 9:\n     \\[\n     P(\\text{not landing at 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 9}) = \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\times \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{4} \\right) \\times \\cdots \\times \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{2^9} \\right)\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     = \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{3}{4} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{7}{8} \\right) \\times \\cdots \\times \\left( \\frac{503}{512} \\right)\n     \\]\n\n6. **Simplifying the Product:**\n   - This product can be written as:\n     \\[\n     P(E) = \\prod_{k=1}^{9} \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{2^k} \\right)\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the product:\n     \\[\n     P(E) = \\prod_{k=1}^{9} \\frac{2^k - 1}{2^k} = \\frac{(2^1 - 1)(2^2 - 1)(2^3 - 1) \\cdots (2^9 - 1)}{2^{1+2+3+\\cdots+9}}\n     \\]\n   - The sum of the exponents is:\n     \\[\n     1 + 2 + 3 + \\cdots + 9 = \\frac{9(10)}{2} = 45\n     \\]\n   - Therefore:\n     \\[\n     P(E) = \\frac{(2^1 - 1)(2^2 - 1)(2^3 - 1) \\cdots (2^9 - 1)}{2^{45}}\n     \\]\n\n7. **Final Answer:**\n   - The probability that Flora will eventually land at 10 is:\n     \\[\n     P(E) = \\frac{m}{n}\n     \\]\n   - To find \\( m+n \\), we need the specific values of \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) from the simplified fraction.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{1}\\)."], "pred": ["1"], "report": [null], "finish_reason": ["stop"], "score": [false]}

{"idx": 27, "question": "For how many ordered pairs $(a,b)$ of integers does the polynomial $x^3+ax^2+bx+6$ have $3$ distinct integer roots?", "gt_cot": "None", "gt": "5", "answer": 5.0, "code": ["Let the roots of $x^3 +ax^2 +bx +6$ be $m$, $n$, and $p$, and let $(r,s,t)$ be an ordered pair such that $m \\in\\{r,s,t\\}$, $n\\in\\{r,s,t\\}$, $p\\in\\{r,s,t\\}$ (e.g. $m=n=p=r$ is allowed). This gives us $m +n +p = -a$, $mn +np +mp = b$, and $mnp = -6$.\nThe only way for this to work is if exactly one of $m$, $n$, and $p$ is negative and the other two are positive, and we can switch which way around the negative and the positive without changing the roots. In fact, we can force the negative root to be $-1$.\nNow, for positive roots $r$, $s$, $t$ we have $r+s+t = -a$, $rs + rt + st = b$, and $rst = 6$, which has solutions $(1,1,6)$, $(2,3,1)$, $(3,2,1)$, $(1,2,3)$, $(6,1,1)$, $(1,6,1)$, $(1,1,6)$, $(1,2,3)$, $(1,3,2)$, $(2,1,3)$, $(2,3,1)$, $(3,1,2)$, and $(3,2,1)$.

When combined, \"enscript\" suggests something that is completely scriptural or canonical, meaning it contains all the necessary elements or guidelines.\n\n\"Script\" typically refers to a written work, especially a religious or legal text, but in this context, it could also refer to a set of standardized rules or procedures that are fundamental to a system or organization. For example, in the context of software development, a set of guidelines or standards that must be followed to ensure consistency and quality in coding practices.\n\n\"Origin\" (アオキミ) is the Japanese name for Barbara, the founder of the company Noorjin. The term \"origin\" in this context likely means the starting point or the source of something, such as the origin of a product, a process, or a company. The abbreviation \"OP\" often stands for \"Oiranu Soto Nihon\" (original products from Japan), which is a term used in Japanese to describe products that are made in Japan and have origins from the country.\n\nTherefore, when we put it all together, the term \"enscriptorigin\" from the company Noorjin seems to be a playful or humorous reference to the idea of creating original, standard-compliant products or a company that focuses on the original and standard norms. However, it appears to be a simplified or metaphorical way of referring to the company itself, possibly suggesting that it is the originator of certain standards or practices within its industry or in Japan.\n\nIn a broader sense, this term could be interpreted as a call to implement or follow standards that are essential and fundamental, much like how a company might focus on producing original and high-quality products that are in line with international or national standards.\n\nအဲဒီ့လေးနဲ့, အသံဖြတ်ပေါ့။"], "pred": ["12"], "report": [null], "finish_reason": ["stop"], "score": [false]}
