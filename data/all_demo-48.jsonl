{"instruction": "Given a linear operator \\( T: V \\to V \\) with characteristic polynomial \\( \\lambda^4(\\lambda-4)^5 \\) and minimal polynomial \\( \\lambda(\\lambda-4) \\), determine the rank of \\( T \\).\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{{}}.", "output": "Okay, so I need to find the rank of a linear operator T: V → V. The given information is that the characteristic polynomial is λ⁴(λ - 4)⁵ and the minimal polynomial is λ(λ - 4). Hmm, let's start by recalling some concepts.\n\nFirst, the rank of a linear operator is the dimension of its image, right? So rank(T) = dim(Im(T)). To find this, maybe I can use the Rank-Nullity Theorem, which says that dim(Im(T)) + dim(Ker(T)) = dim(V). But to use that, I need to figure out dim(Ker(T)), the nullity of T. Alternatively, maybe there's another approach using the given polynomials.\n\nThe characteristic polynomial is λ⁴(λ - 4)⁵. That tells me the eigenvalues are 0 and 4, with algebraic multiplicities 4 and 5, respectively. So the operator T has eigenvalues 0 and 4. The minimal polynomial is λ(λ - 4), which factors into distinct linear terms, so T is diagonalizable. Wait, if the minimal polynomial has no repeated roots, then the operator is diagonalizable. So T is diagonalizable. That might be helpful.\n\nSince T is diagonalizable, the algebraic multiplicities of the eigenvalues correspond to the dimensions of the corresponding eigenspaces. So the eigenspace for 0 has dimension 4, and the eigenspace for 4 has dimension 5. Therefore, the nullity of T (dimension of the kernel) is the dimension of the eigenspace for 0, which is 4. Then, by Rank-Nullity, the rank would be dim(V) - nullity(T) = (4 + 5) - 4 = 5. Wait, but hold on, is that correct?\n\nWait, dim(V) is the degree of the characteristic polynomial. The characteristic polynomial is degree 4 + 5 = 9, so dim(V) = 9. So if the nullity is 4, then the rank is 9 - 4 = 5. That seems straightforward, but let me check if there's another way to see this.\n\nAlternatively, if T is diagonalizable, then in a basis of eigenvectors, the matrix of T is diagonal with four 0s and five 4s on the diagonal. Then, the image of T would be the span of the eigenvectors corresponding to non-zero eigenvalues. So each eigenvector with eigenvalue 4 would be mapped to 4 times themselves, so they are in the image. The eigenvectors with eigenvalue 0 are in the kernel. So the image is the span of the eigenvectors for 4, which has dimension 5. Therefore, rank(T) is 5. That matches the previous calculation.\n\nBut let me think again. Since the minimal polynomial is λ(λ - 4), that tells me that the largest Jordan blocks for each eigenvalue are of size 1. Therefore, the Jordan form is diagonal, so T is diagonalizable. So yes, that reasoning is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the structure of the minimal polynomial. The minimal polynomial is the product of (λ - 0) and (λ - 4), which are distinct linear factors, so again, T is diagonalizable. So the nullity is the algebraic multiplicity of 0, which is 4, so rank is 9 - 4 = 5. So the answer should be 5.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me confirm if the algebraic multiplicity of 0 is indeed the nullity. That is true if the operator is diagonalizable. Because in that case, the geometric multiplicity (dimension of the eigenspace) equals the algebraic multiplicity. So if T is diagonalizable, then yes, the dimension of the kernel (nullity) is 4, so rank is 5. Therefore, the rank of T is 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to express T in terms of its action on the generalized eigenspaces. But since the minimal polynomial splits into linear factors and is square-free, there are no generalized eigenvectors, only actual eigenvectors.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: the rank can be calculated as the trace of T squared divided by the trace of T, but wait, no, that's not a standard formula. Maybe not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the image of T is the direct sum of the images of the restrictions of T to each generalized eigenspace. Since T is diagonalizable, the generalized eigenspaces are just the eigenspaces. The restriction of T to the eigenspace of 0 is the zero operator, whose image is {0}, and the restriction to the eigenspace of 4 is multiplication by 4, which is invertible (since 4 ≠ 0), so the image is the entire eigenspace. Therefore, the image of T is the eigenspace corresponding to 4, which has dimension 5. Therefore, rank(T) = 5.\n\nYes, that all lines up. So I think the rank is 5. Let me just check if there's any possible mistake here.\n\nWait, could the minimal polynomial being λ(λ - 4) instead of something else affect this? For example, if the minimal polynomial had higher degrees, maybe there would be larger Jordan blocks, but in this case, since the minimal polynomial is square-free, the operator is diagonalizable, so no Jordan blocks, just diagonal matrices. Therefore, the eigenspaces are as big as the algebraic multiplicities. So, the nullity is 4, rank is 5. So I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe rank of \\( T \\) is \\boxed{5}."}

If the \\(x_i\\) values are pairwise distinct, determine the rank of matrix B.\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{{}}.", "output": "Okay, let me try to figure out the rank of matrix B. So, matrix B is constructed from matrix A by removing the last row, and A is an m x m matrix. The problem mentions that the x_i values are pairwise distinct. Hmm, but what exactly is matrix A? The question doesn't specify the structure of A. Wait, maybe it's implied? Since it mentions x_i values being distinct, maybe A is a Vandermonde matrix? Because Vandermonde matrices are common in contexts with distinct x_i values. Let me check.\n\nA Vandermonde matrix is typically structured with entries A_ij = x_i^{j-1}, right? So, for example, the first row is 1, x_1, x_1^2, ..., x_1^{m-1}, the second row is 1, x_2, x_2^2, ..., x_2^{m-1}, and so on. And a key property of a Vandermonde matrix is that if all x_i are distinct, then the matrix has full rank, which is m in this case because it's square. So, if A is a Vandermonde matrix of size m x m with distinct x_i, then its rank is m. But matrix B is constructed by removing the last row of A, resulting in a (m-1) x m matrix. Wait, no, wait. The problem says B is (m-1) x (m-1). Hmmm. Wait, if you remove the last row from an m x m matrix A, you get a (m-1) x m matrix. But the problem states B is (m-1) x (m-1). So maybe A is an (m) x (m-1) matrix? But that wouldn't make sense for a Vandermonde matrix. Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"matrix B with dimensions (m-1) x (m-1) constructed from a matrix A by removing the last row.\" So, A must have been an m x (m-1) matrix. So removing the last row of an m x (m-1) matrix gives a (m-1) x (m-1) matrix B. So, A is m x (m-1), B is (m-1) x (m-1). Then, we need to determine the rank of B, given that the x_i are pairwise distinct. But again, the structure of A is not given. So, maybe there's a standard matrix A associated with distinct x_i's? The only common matrix I can think of here is the Vandermonde matrix, but a Vandermonde matrix is usually square. Wait, unless A is a rectangular Vandermonde matrix. For example, an m x n Vandermonde matrix where each row is 1, x_i, x_i^2, ..., x_i^{n-1}. So, if A is m x (m-1) Vandermonde matrix with m-1 columns, then each row would be [1, x_i, x_i^2, ..., x_i^{m-2}]. Then, if we remove the last row, the resulting matrix B is (m-1) x (m-1) Vandermonde matrix with rows corresponding to x_1, x_2, ..., x_{m-1}. Since all x_i are distinct, a square Vandermonde matrix with distinct nodes has full rank. Therefore, B would have rank m-1. Therefore, the rank of B is m-1.\n\nBut wait, let me verify. Suppose A is an m x (m-1) Vandermonde matrix with entries A_ij = x_i^{j-1}, for i=1,...,m and j=1,...,m-1. Then, B is the matrix obtained by removing the last row of A, so it's (m-1) x (m-1). Since the x_i's are distinct, the determinant of B is the Vandermonde determinant product_{1 ≤ i < j ≤ m-1} (x_j - x_i), which is non-zero because all x_i are distinct. Therefore, B is invertible, hence has rank m-1. Therefore, the answer should be m-1.\n\nBut before finalizing this, let me make sure that the problem didn't refer to a different matrix A. The problem states \"constructed from a matrix A by removing the last row\", but doesn't specify A. However, since x_i are pairwise distinct, Vandermonde is the most likely candidate here. Alternatively, maybe A is a confluent Vandermonde matrix or something else, but given the mention of distinct x_i, the standard Vandermonde is probable.\n\nAlternatively, suppose A is a matrix where each row is related to x_i, but in another way. For example, a matrix with entries A_ij = x_i^{j} (without the 1), but then again, similar logic applies. If it's a polynomial basis matrix, removing a row but keeping the distinct x_i's would retain full rank. But if A is m x (m-1) and B is (m-1) x (m-1), then as long as the remaining rows are linearly independent, which they would be if they come from distinct x_i in a Vandermonde setup, then B would have rank m-1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A is a different type of matrix, like a diagonal matrix? But if A is diagonal, removing a row would leave a diagonal matrix with one fewer row, which would have rank m-1 if all diagonal entries are non-zero. But in that case, the original A would have to be m x (m-1) diagonal, which is a bit non-standard. Moreover, diagonal matrices don't really involve pairwise distinct x_i's in the same way as Vandermonde.\n\nAlternatively, maybe A is a Cauchy matrix, but again, similar to Vandermonde, Cauchy matrices have structures that ensure non-singularity with distinct parameters. But the problem doesn't specify, so the safest assumption is Vandermonde.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be referring to a matrix A where each row is [1, x_i, x_i^2, ..., x_i^{m-1}], making A an m x m Vandermonde matrix. Then removing the last row would result in a (m-1) x m matrix, but the problem states B is (m-1) x (m-1). So perhaps in this case, maybe we are also removing the last column? But the problem only mentions removing the last row. Hmm, that's a discrepancy. Wait, maybe A is not square. If A is m x (m-1), then removing the last row gives (m-1) x (m-1) matrix B. If A is a Vandermonde matrix with m rows and m-1 columns, then B is a smaller Vandermonde matrix with m-1 rows and m-1 columns. Since the x_i's are distinct, the determinant is non-zero, so B is invertible, hence rank m-1. So that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, suppose A is a different type of matrix where each row corresponds to a polynomial evaluated at x_i. For example, if A is a collocation matrix for a polynomial basis, with rows corresponding to different x_i's. Then, if the x_i are distinct, such a matrix would have full rank if the number of columns (which is the number of basis functions) is less than or equal to the number of rows. So, if A is m x (m-1), then B is (m-1) x (m-1), and since the x_i are distinct, the collocation matrix B would have full rank m-1. So again, rank m-1.\n\nTherefore, given that the x_i are pairwise distinct, and B is a square matrix of size (m-1) x (m-1) constructed by removing the last row of A, which is presumably a Vandermonde or similar polynomial basis matrix, the rank should be full, i.e., m-1. So the answer is \\boxed{m-1}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{m-1}"}

Hmm. Let's see. Both the numerator and the denominator approach sin(π) as x approaches 1, right? Because x^a and x^b both approach 1 when x approaches 1, so sin(π*1) is sin(π) which is 0. So this is a 0/0 indeterminate form. Normally, I might think to use l'Hôpital's rule here, but the problem says not to. So I need another approach.\n\nMaybe I can use the fact that sin(θ) ≈ θ when θ is near 0. But here, when x is near 1, x^a and x^b are near 1, so πx^a and πx^b are near π. But sin(π) is 0, so maybe I need to expand around x = 1. Let me set x = 1 + h, where h is approaching 0. Then x^a = (1 + h)^a ≈ 1 + a h, using the first-order Taylor expansion. Similarly, x^b ≈ 1 + b h. Then sin(πx^a) ≈ sin(π(1 + a h)) = sin(π + π a h). And sin(π + π a h) is equal to -sin(π a h) because sin(π + θ) = -sinθ. Similarly, sin(π x^b) ≈ -sin(π b h). Therefore, the ratio becomes [-sin(π a h)] / [-sin(π b h)] = sin(π a h)/sin(π b h). Then, since h is approaching 0, we can use the approximation sin(θ) ≈ θ for small θ. So this becomes (π a h)/(π b h) = a/b. Therefore, the limit is a/b. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me check if I did that correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can substitute t = x - 1, so as t approaches 0, x approaches 1. Then x = 1 + t. Then x^a = (1 + t)^a ≈ 1 + a t, and x^b ≈ 1 + b t. Then sin(πx^a) ≈ sin(π(1 + a t)) = sin(π + π a t) = -sin(π a t) ≈ -π a t. Similarly, sin(πx^b) ≈ -π b t. Then the ratio is (-π a t)/(-π b t) = a/b. So that's the same result. So seems like the limit is a/b.\n\nBut let me think again. Is there another way to approach this without substitution? Maybe using the identity for sin(A) / sin(B). Let me recall that sin(A)/sin(B) can sometimes be expressed using product formulas or angle addition, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the expansion around x = 1.\n\nAlternatively, write x = 1 + h where h approaches 0. Then x^a = e^{a ln(1 + h)} ≈ e^{a (h - h^2/2 + ...)} ≈ 1 + a h + (a^2 - a) h^2 / 2 + ... But maybe this is complicating things. Wait, perhaps instead of expanding x^a as a power series, I can use the expansion of sin(π x^a) around x = 1.\n\nLet me set x = 1 + h, where h approaches 0. Then x^a = (1 + h)^a ≈ 1 + a h + O(h^2). So π x^a ≈ π + π a h + O(h^2). Then sin(π x^a) = sin(π + π a h + O(h^2)) = sin(π + π a h) + O(h^2). Since sin(π + θ) = -sinθ, this is equal to -sin(π a h) + O(h^2). Then, using sin(π a h) ≈ π a h - (π a h)^3 / 6 + ..., so sin(π x^a) ≈ -π a h + O(h^3). Similarly, sin(π x^b) ≈ -π b h + O(h^3). Therefore, the ratio sin(πx^a)/sin(πx^b) ≈ (-π a h)/(-π b h) = a/b. The higher order terms become negligible as h approaches 0, so the limit is a/b.\n\nAlternatively, use substitution: Let y = x - 1, so y approaches 0 as x approaches 1. Then, write the limit as y approaches 0 of sin(π(1 + y)^a) / sin(π(1 + y)^b). Then expand (1 + y)^a ≈ 1 + a y and (1 + y)^b ≈ 1 + b y. Then, similar to before, sin(π(1 + a y)) / sin(π(1 + b y)) = sin(π + π a y) / sin(π + π b y) = (-sin(π a y))/(-sin(π b y)) = sin(π a y)/sin(π b y). Then, as y approaches 0, sin(π a y) ≈ π a y and sin(π b y) ≈ π b y, so the ratio is (π a y)/(π b y) = a/b.\n\nAnother approach: Let me use the identity sin(A) / sin(B) = [A/B] * [sin(A)/A] / [sin(B)/B]. Then, if A and B approach 0, then sin(A)/A and sin(B)/B both approach 1. But in this case, when x approaches 1, A = π x^a - π = π(x^a - 1) and B = π x^b - π = π(x^b - 1). So if I write sin(π x^a) / sin(π x^b) = [π(x^a - 1)/π(x^b - 1)] * [sin(π x^a)/π(x^a - 1)] / [sin(π x^b)/π(x^b - 1)]. Then as x approaches 1, x^a - 1 ≈ a(x - 1) and x^b - 1 ≈ b(x - 1). Therefore, the first factor becomes [a(x - 1)/b(x - 1)] = a/b. The second and third factors approach sin(π + small)/π(small). Wait, but sin(π + ε) = -sin(ε) ≈ -ε, so [sin(π x^a)/π(x^a - 1)] ≈ [-π(x^a - 1)]/[π(x^a - 1)] = -1. Similarly for the denominator term. Wait, so maybe [sin(π x^a)/π(x^a - 1)] ≈ -1/[π(x^a - 1)] * π(x^a - 1) = -1. Wait, maybe I need to check that again.\n\nLet me compute sin(π x^a) / [π(x^a - 1)]. Let’s set ε = x^a - 1. Then π x^a = π(1 + ε) = π + π ε. So sin(π x^a) = sin(π + π ε) = -sin(π ε). Therefore, sin(π x^a) / [π(x^a - 1)] = -sin(π ε) / (π ε). As x approaches 1, ε approaches 0, so sin(π ε)/(π ε) approaches 1. Therefore, the whole expression approaches -1. Similarly, the denominator term sin(π x^b)/[π(x^b - 1)] approaches -1. Therefore, the ratio [sin(π x^a)/π(x^a - 1)] / [sin(π x^b)/π(x^b - 1)] approaches (-1)/(-1) = 1. Therefore, the entire limit is (a/b) * 1 = a/b.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, substitution or expansion, the limit seems to be a/b. Let me check with specific values. Suppose a = 2, b = 1. Then the limit becomes sin(π x^2)/sin(π x). As x approaches 1, let's substitute x = 1 + h. Then x^2 = 1 + 2h + h^2. So sin(π x^2) = sin(π + 2π h + π h^2) = -sin(2π h + π h^2) ≈ -2π h. Similarly, sin(π x) = sin(π + π h) = -sin(π h) ≈ -π h. Therefore, the ratio is (-2π h)/(-π h) = 2, which is a/b = 2/1 = 2. That checks out. Another example: a = 3, b = 2. Then the limit should be 3/2. Let's test x approaching 1. Let x = 1 + h. Then x^3 ≈ 1 + 3h, x^2 ≈ 1 + 2h. Then sin(π x^3) ≈ sin(π + 3π h) ≈ -3π h. sin(π x^2) ≈ sin(π + 2π h) ≈ -2π h. The ratio is (-3π h)/(-2π h) = 3/2. Yep, works. So seems like the conclusion is correct.\n\nTherefore, the limit is a/b.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe limit is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{a}{b}}\\)."}

The integral given is \\( 4\\pi R \\int_{-r}^{r}\\sqrt{r^2 - y^2}dy \\). Hmm, I remember that a torus is like a doughnut shape, right? It's generated by rotating a circle of radius r around an axis that's a distance R away from the center of the circle. So, using the method of integration to calculate the volume... maybe this is using the method of cylindrical shells or the washer method?\n\nWait, the integral involves sqrt(r² - y²), which looks like the equation of a semicircle. If I integrate that from -r to r, that should give the area of a semicircle, but actually, integrating sqrt(r² - y²) dy from -r to r gives the area of a semicircle, which is (1/2)πr². But here, we have this integral multiplied by 4πR. Let me check.\n\nIf I recall, the volume of a torus can be found using the theorem of Pappus, which states that the volume of a solid of revolution is equal to the product of the area of the shape being rotated and the distance traveled by its centroid. For a torus, the area being rotated is the area of the circle, which is πr², and the centroid of the circle is at a distance R from the axis of rotation. So the volume should be πr² * 2πR = 2π²Rr². Wait, but the given integral seems different. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they are setting up the integral using the method where you integrate the circumference at each y-coordinate multiplied by the height? Let me think. If we slice the torus horizontally at a height y, the circumference of the circular path at that height would be 2π times the radius of the circular path. The radius of the path would be R plus the horizontal distance from the center of the generating circle to the slice. Wait, but in the integral, we have sqrt(r² - y²), which is the x-coordinate of the circle. So perhaps each horizontal slice is a circle with radius R + x, where x is sqrt(r² - y²), but actually, when you rotate around the axis, each vertical slice at height y would form a circle with radius R + x, where x is the horizontal distance from the center of the generating circle to the point on the circle. But since we are integrating over y, maybe it's the other way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the washer method. If we consider rotating the circle around the y-axis, but the torus is actually generated by rotating around an axis that's offset by R. Wait, no. The standard torus is generated by rotating a circle of radius r around an axis that is a distance R away from the center of the circle. So if we set up coordinates such that the center of the generating circle is at (R, 0, 0) in 3D space, and we rotate around the z-axis. To compute the volume using the method of integrating cross-sectional areas, perhaps we can use cylindrical shells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the integral given is already set up using the method of integrating the circumference times the differential area. Let's parse the integral: 4πR multiplied by the integral of sqrt(r² - y²) dy from -r to r. The sqrt(r² - y²) is the equation of a semicircle in the y-axis, so integrating that from -r to r gives the area of a semicircle, which is (1/2)πr². Then multiplying by 4πR gives 4πR*(1/2)πr² = 2π²Rr². Wait, but that's actually the same result as Pappus' theorem! So that would be the volume of the torus. So maybe the integral is already set up correctly, and evaluating it just requires recognizing that the integral of sqrt(r² - y²) dy from -r to r is (πr²)/2, and then multiplying by 4πR gives 2π²Rr², which is the standard formula.\n\nBut let me verify this step by step. Let's first compute the integral ∫_{-r}^{r} sqrt(r² - y²) dy. That's the integral of the upper half of a circle, which is the area of a semicircle. The area of a full circle is πr², so the area of a semicircle is (1/2)πr². Therefore, the integral equals (1/2)πr². Then multiplying by 4πR gives 4πR*(1/2)πr² = 2π²Rr², which is indeed the volume of the torus. So that seems to check out.\n\nBut maybe the problem wants me to compute the integral from scratch without referencing the area of a semicircle. Let's try that. So to evaluate ∫_{-r}^{r} sqrt(r² - y²) dy. Let's make a substitution. Let y = r sinθ, so dy = r cosθ dθ. Then when y = -r, sinθ = -1, so θ = -π/2, and when y = r, sinθ = 1, so θ = π/2. Then the integral becomes ∫_{-π/2}^{π/2} sqrt(r² - r² sin²θ) * r cosθ dθ. Simplify the sqrt: sqrt(r²(1 - sin²θ)) = sqrt(r² cos²θ) = r cosθ. So the integral becomes ∫_{-π/2}^{π/2} r cosθ * r cosθ dθ = r² ∫_{-π/2}^{π/2} cos²θ dθ.\n\nUsing the identity cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2, the integral becomes (r²/2) ∫_{-π/2}^{π/2} (1 + cos2θ) dθ. Integrating term by term: the integral of 1 dθ from -π/2 to π/2 is [θ] from -π/2 to π/2 = π/2 - (-π/2) = π. The integral of cos2θ dθ is (1/2) sin2θ evaluated from -π/2 to π/2. sin2θ at π/2 is sinπ = 0, and at -π/2 is sin(-π) = 0. So the second term is zero. Therefore, the integral is (r²/2)(π + 0) = (π r²)/2. So that's the same result as before. Therefore, the original integral is (π r²)/2. Then multiplying by 4πR gives 4πR*(π r²)/2 = 2π² R r². So the volume is 2π² R r², which is the standard formula. So that's correct.\n\nBut let me just check once more. If I recall, the formula for the volume of a torus is (πr²)(2πR), which is the area of the circle times the distance traveled by its centroid. The centroid of the circle is at distance R from the axis, so when rotated around, it travels a circumference of 2πR. Therefore, the volume is indeed πr² * 2πR = 2π² R r². So yes, that's correct. Therefore, evaluating the given integral, which is 4πR times the integral of sqrt(r² - y²) dy from -r to r, gives 4πR*(π r²/2) = 2π² R r², which matches the known formula.\n\nTherefore, the volume of the torus is \\( 2\\pi^2 R r^2 \\). So I think that's the final answer. Let me just recap all the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything. The integral was set up as 4πR times the integral of sqrt(r² - y²) dy from -r to r. Recognizing that the integral of sqrt(r² - y²) dy is the area of a semicircle, which is (1/2)πr². Multiplying that by 4πR gives 2π² R r². Alternatively, computing the integral via substitution y = r sinθ leads to the same result. So everything checks out. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe volume of the torus is \\boxed{2\\pi^2 R r^2}."}

Hmm, automorphism... right, an automorphism is a bijective homomorphism from a group to itself. So first, I should check if g is a homomorphism, meaning it preserves the group operation. In the case of (ℝ, +), the group operation is addition. So, for g to be a homomorphism, we need that g(x + y) = g(x) + g(y) for all x, y in ℝ.\n\nLet me write that down: g(x + y) = a(x + y)². And g(x) + g(y) = ax² + ay². So setting these equal: a(x + y)² = ax² + ay². Let's expand the left side: a(x² + 2xy + y²) = ax² + 2axy + ay². The right side is just ax² + ay². So, setting them equal: ax² + 2axy + ay² = ax² + ay². Subtracting ax² + ay² from both sides, we get 2axy = 0. This needs to hold for all x, y in ℝ. Hmm, so 2a xy = 0 for all x, y in ℝ. But the product xy can be non-zero for many x and y (for example, x=1, y=1). The only way 2a xy = 0 for all x and y is if a = 0. But wait, if a=0, then g(x) = 0 for all x, which is definitely not bijective (it's not injective or surjective). So that's a problem.\n\nSo, does that mean there are no such 'a' for which g(x) = ax² is an automorphism? But that can't be right, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. Wait, maybe I confused automorphism with homomorphism. The question specifically asks for automorphism, which requires it to be a bijective homomorphism. So even if there were a non-zero 'a' for which g is a homomorphism, we would still need it to be bijective.\n\nBut from the homomorphism condition, we saw that only a=0 works, but that's not bijective. So does that mean there are no such 'a'? But that seems odd. Let me think again. Maybe my approach is wrong. Wait, maybe the function is supposed to be from (ℝ, +) to itself, so the operation is addition. So homomorphism requires g(x + y) = g(x) + g(y). So if g(x) = ax², then g(x + y) = a(x + y)² = a(x² + 2xy + y²). But g(x) + g(y) = ax² + ay². So unless the cross term 2axy is zero for all x and y, which would require a=0. So indeed, only a=0, but that's the zero map, which is not an automorphism. Therefore, there are no such non-zero a?\n\nBut wait, maybe the problem was written incorrectly? Or maybe I have a misunderstanding. Let me confirm the definition of automorphism. An automorphism is an isomorphism from a group to itself, so it's a bijective homomorphism. So, the homomorphism part requires preserving the group operation, which is addition here. So unless the function is linear, right? Because additive functions on ℝ that are homomorphisms are linear functions. For example, functions of the form g(x) = kx for some constant k. These are the only continuous homomorphisms, actually. But if we don't assume continuity, there might be more, but in this case, the function given is quadratic, which is smooth, so if it's a homomorphism, it must be linear. So quadratic functions can't be homomorphisms unless the quadratic term is zero. So, that would require a=0. But that's not an automorphism.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that there is no such non-zero a for which g(x) = ax² is an automorphism of (ℝ, +). So the set of values of a is empty? But maybe the problem is expecting something else. Wait, let me check again. Maybe there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, perhaps the group is multiplicative? But no, the group is specified as (ℝ, +). So addition is the operation. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the automorphism is considered in a different category, like vector spaces or something else. But no, the question specifically says group automorphism. So in the context of groups, the automorphism has to preserve the group operation, which is addition. So, unless the function is additive, which quadratic functions are not, unless the quadratic part is zero.\n\nTherefore, only a=0 makes g(x) = ax² a homomorphism, but it's not bijective. Hence, there are no such values of a. Therefore, the set is empty. But the problem says \"the set of values of a\", so maybe the answer is a = 0? But no, because even though a=0 gives a homomorphism, it's not an automorphism. So perhaps the answer is no solutions exist? So the set is empty.\n\nWait, let me verify with an example. Suppose a is non-zero. Then g(x) = ax². Let's check if it's injective. Suppose g(x) = g(y). Then ax² = ay². If a ≠ 0, then x² = y², so x = y or x = -y. So unless x = y, which is not guaranteed. For example, g(1) = a and g(-1) = a, so it's not injective. Therefore, for a ≠ 0, the function is not injective, hence not bijective. For a = 0, it's the zero function, which is not injective or surjective. Therefore, for no value of a is g(x) = ax² bijective. So combining both homomorphism and bijective conditions, there are no such a. Therefore, the set is empty.\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's possible that the answer is a = 0, but that's not an automorphism. So maybe the question is a trick question. Alternatively, perhaps there was a typo, and the function was meant to be linear, like ax. But as written, it's ax².\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in a different group structure? Like, maybe considering ℝ under a different operation where squaring is a homomorphism. But the problem states the group is (ℝ, +), so addition is the operation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe they consider the function from (ℝ, +) to (ℝ, +), but allowing for non-injective or non-surjective? But no, automorphism requires bijectivity.\n\nTherefore, after all this, I think the answer is that there are no such a. Therefore, the set is empty. So, in boxed notation, that would be \\boxed{\\emptyset}. Alternatively, if they expect a value, maybe a=0, but since that's not an automorphism, probably the empty set.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe set of values of \\( a \\) is \\boxed{\\emptyset}."}

Hmm, let me recall some basic topology on the prime spectrum of a ring.\n\nFirst, the Zariski topology on \\( \\text{Spec}(A) \\) has closed sets of the form \\( V(I) = \\{ q \\in \\text{Spec}(A) \\mid I \\subseteq q \\} \\), where \\( I \\) is an ideal of \\( A \\). So, closed sets are essentially all prime ideals containing some ideal \\( I \\). Now, the closure of a subset \\( S \\) in a topological space is the smallest closed set containing \\( S \\). So, for the closure of \\( \\{ p \\} \\), we need the smallest closed set that includes all prime ideals in \\( \\text{Spec}(A) \\) that are in the closure of \\( p \\).\n\nWait, but actually, closure of a point is the intersection of all closed sets containing that point. Alternatively, the closure of \\( \\{ p \\} \\) is the set of all prime ideals that are in every closed set containing \\( p \\). Since closed sets are \\( V(I) \\), which are primes containing \\( I \\), the closed sets containing \\( p \\) are those \\( V(I) \\) where \\( I \\subseteq p \\). Therefore, the intersection of all such \\( V(I) \\) would be the set of primes containing every ideal contained in \\( p \\). But what's the intersection of all ideals contained in \\( p \\)? Hmm, maybe not the right way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think about the closure of \\( \\{ p \\} \\) as the set of all prime ideals \\( q \\) such that every open neighborhood of \\( q \\) contains \\( p \\). In the Zariski topology, basic open sets are \\( D(f) = \\{ q \\in \\text{Spec}(A) \\mid f \\notin q \\} \\) for \\( f \\in A \\). So, \\( q \\) is in the closure of \\( \\{ p \\} \\) if every basic open set containing \\( q \\) also contains \\( p \\). That is, for every \\( f \\notin q \\), we have \\( f \\notin p \\). Because if \\( f \\notin q \\), then \\( D(f) \\) is an open neighborhood of \\( q \\), and if \\( p \\) is in \\( D(f) \\), then \\( f \\notin p \\). So, this translates to: if \\( f \\notin q \\), then \\( f \\notin p \\). Which is equivalent to \\( p \\subseteq q \\), because if \\( f \\in p \\), then \\( f \\in q \\), so \\( p \\subseteq q \\).\n\nTherefore, the closure of \\( \\{ p \\} \\) should be the set of all prime ideals containing \\( p \\), which is exactly \\( V(p) \\). Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nBut let me check this again. Suppose \\( q \\) is in the closure of \\( \\{ p \\} \\). Then, every open neighborhood of \\( q \\) contains \\( p \\). So, if \\( q \\) is not containing \\( p \\), then there exists some element \\( f \\in p \\) but \\( f \\notin q \\). Then, the open set \\( D(f) \\) would contain \\( q \\), because \\( f \\notin q \\), but \\( p \\) is not in \\( D(f) \\), since \\( f \\in p \\). That's a contradiction. Therefore, such \\( q \\) must contain \\( p \\). Conversely, if \\( q \\) contains \\( p \\), then any open neighborhood \\( D(f) \\) containing \\( q \\) must have \\( f \\notin q \\), which implies \\( f \\notin p \\), hence \\( p \\in D(f) \\). Therefore, \\( p \\) is in every open neighborhood of \\( q \\), so \\( q \\) is in the closure of \\( \\{ p \\} \\). Thus, the closure is exactly \\( V(p) \\).\n\nTherefore, the closure of \\( \\{ p \\} \\) is indeed \\( V(p) \\). So, the answer should be yes. But I need to confirm if I didn't make any mistake in the reasoning.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: The closure of a point \\( p \\) in a topological space is the set of all points \\( q \\) such that \\( q \\) is a specialization of \\( p \\). In the case of the Zariski topology on \\( \\text{Spec}(A) \\), the specialization order is given by inclusion: \\( q \\) is a specialization of \\( p \\) if \\( q \\subseteq p \\), but wait, no, actually, the closure of \\( p \\) should be the generization... Wait, maybe I confused.\n\nWait, in the Zariski topology, the closure of \\( \\{ p \\} \\) should be the set of all primes that are contained in \\( p \\), but that contradicts what I thought earlier. Wait, hold on. No, actually, let's think again. If the closed sets are \\( V(I) \\), which are primes containing \\( I \\), then the closure of \\( \\{ p \\} \\) is the smallest closed set containing \\( p \\). The closed sets containing \\( p \\) are \\( V(I) \\) where \\( I \\subseteq p \\). The intersection of all such \\( V(I) \\) would be \\( V(p) \\), since \\( V(p) \\) is exactly the set of primes containing \\( p \\), and if you take any smaller closed set \\( V(I) \\) with \\( I \\subsetneq p \\), then \\( V(I) \\) would contain primes containing \\( I \\), which may or may not contain \\( p \\). Wait, actually, if \\( I \\subseteq p \\), then \\( V(I) \\) includes all primes containing \\( I \\), which includes \\( p \\), but primes larger than \\( p \\). However, the intersection over all \\( V(I) \\) where \\( I \\subseteq p \\) would be the set of primes that contain every ideal contained in \\( p \\). But the intersection of all such ideals \\( I \\subseteq p \\) is the nilradical of \\( p \\)? Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the closure of \\( \\{ p \\} \\) is equal to \\( V(p) \\). Let me check this with an example. Take \\( A = \\mathbb{Z} \\), then \\( \\text{Spec}(\\mathbb{Z}) \\) is the set of prime ideals \\( (0) \\) and \\( (p) \\) for primes \\( p \\). The closure of \\( \\{ (0) \\} \\) is all primes containing \\( (0) \\), which is the entire space, since every prime ideal contains \\( (0) \\). But actually, in this case, \\( (0) \\) is the generic point, and its closure is indeed the whole space. Wait, but that contradicts the idea that the closure might be \\( V(p) \\). Wait, but if \\( p = (0) \\), then \\( V(p) \\) is \\( V(0) = \\text{Spec}(A) \\). So, yes, that works.\n\nAnother example: take \\( A = k[x] \\), where \\( k \\) is a field. Then \\( \\text{Spec}(A) \\) consists of \\( (0) \\) and \\( (f) \\), where \\( f \\) is irreducible. The closure of \\( \\{ (f) \\} \\) is \\( V(f) \\), which is the set of all primes containing \\( (f) \\), i.e., \\( (f) \\) itself and any prime ideal containing it. But in \\( k[x] \\), all non-zero primes are maximal, so \\( V(f) = \\{ (f) \\} \\). Wait, that's a closed point. So, in this case, the closure of \\( \\{ (f) \\} \\) is itself, which is \\( V(f) \\). So, yes, again, the closure is \\( V(f) \\).\n\nWait, but if \\( A = k[x,y] \\), then take \\( p = (x) \\). The closure of \\( \\{ (x) \\} \\) should be \\( V(x) \\), which is all prime ideals containing \\( (x) \\). These are primes like \\( (x) \\), \\( (x, y) \\), \\( (x, y - a) \\) for \\( a \\in k \\), etc. So, in this case, the closure of \\( \\{ (x) \\} \\) is the set of all primes containing \\( x \\), which is indeed \\( V(x) \\). So, if we take a prime ideal \\( q \\) containing \\( p \\), then \\( q \\) is in the closure, and if \\( q \\) does not contain \\( p \\), then there exists an open neighborhood around \\( q \\) not containing \\( p \\).\n\nSo, through examples and reasoning, it seems that the closure of \\( \\{ p \\} \\) is indeed \\( V(p) \\). Therefore, the answer should be yes, the closure is equal to \\( V(p) \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{V(p)}"}

Provide your answer in terms of the structure of the group.\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{{}}.", "output": "Okay, so I need to find the Galois group of Q[β] over Q, where β is a root of x³ - 2. Hmm, let's start by recalling some Galois theory basics. The Galois group is the group of automorphisms of the field extension Q[β] that fix Q. But wait, first I should check if the extension Q[β] is a Galois extension. For that, it needs to be normal and separable. Since we're in characteristic zero, all extensions are separable, so that's taken care of. But is it normal? A normal extension is one where every irreducible polynomial over Q that has a root in the extension splits completely in that extension. The polynomial here is x³ - 2, and β is a root of that. But x³ - 2 factors as (x - β)(x² + βx + β²). The quadratic factor might not split in Q[β], right? Because the roots would be β times the primitive cube roots of unity, which are complex numbers. Since Q[β] is a subfield of the real numbers if β is the real cube root of 2, then the other roots are complex and not in Q[β]. Therefore, the extension Q[β] is not normal over Q. That means the Galois group Gal(Q[β]/Q) is not the full Galois group of x³ - 2. Instead, maybe we need to consider the splitting field of x³ - 2 over Q, which would include all the roots. But wait, the question specifically asks for Gal(Q[β]/Q). Hmm, maybe I misread it. Let me check again. \"Compute the Galois group Gal(Q[β]/Q), where β is a root of the polynomial x³ - 2.\" So the field in question is Q[β], which is a degree 3 extension over Q because the minimal polynomial of β is x³ - 2, which is irreducible by Eisenstein's criterion with p=2. So [Q[β] : Q] = 3. Since the extension is of degree 3, the Galois group should have order equal to the degree if the extension is Galois. But since we just saw that the extension isn't normal, the Galois group should have order less than 3. Wait, but the order of the Galois group is equal to the degree of the extension if and only if the extension is Galois. Since it's not Galois here, the order of the Galois group must be less than 3. But the degree is 3. Hmm, so does that mean the Galois group is trivial? Or is there something else going on?\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify. The Galois group Gal(Q[β]/Q) consists of all Q-automorphisms of Q[β]. Since Q[β] is a simple extension generated by β, any automorphism is determined by where it sends β. But β must be mapped to another root of its minimal polynomial. The minimal polynomial is x³ - 2, which has roots β, βω, and βω², where ω is a primitive cube root of unity. However, ω is not in Q[β] if β is real. Because if β is the real cube root of 2, then Q[β] is a subfield of R, and ω is complex, not real. Therefore, the only root of x³ - 2 in Q[β] is β itself. Hence, the only Q-automorphism of Q[β] is the identity automorphism. Therefore, the Galois group is trivial. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Is there a mistake here? Let me double-check.\n\nIf we have a field extension K/F that is not normal, then the number of F-automorphisms of K is less than [K : F]. In this case, [Q[β] : Q] = 3, so the Galois group should have order dividing 3. Since the extension is not normal, automorphisms can't map β to any conjugate not in Q[β]. The conjugates of β are β, βω, βω². If βω and βω² are not in Q[β], then the only automorphism is the identity. Therefore, Gal(Q[β]/Q) is trivial. But is that correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a non-trivial automorphism. Suppose someone claims that there is an automorphism sending β to βω. But if ω isn't in Q[β], then such an automorphism would not be well-defined. Because if τ is an automorphism, then τ(β) must be another root in the field. Since βω isn't in Q[β], τ(β) can't be βω. So τ must fix β, hence τ is the identity. Therefore, the Galois group is indeed trivial. But wait, in some references, they might mention that the Galois group of a non-normal extension is not transitive on the roots, but in this case, since there are no automorphisms except the identity, it's trivial. So, I think that's the conclusion. But I should verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Q[β] has degree 3 over Q, and the automorphism group is trivial, which would mean the extension is not Galois, as the order of the Galois group is 1, which does not equal the degree 3. Therefore, confirming that it's not a Galois extension. So the answer is that the Galois group is the trivial group. But I need to make sure.\n\nWait, let me check an example. Consider Q[2^{1/3}]. The minimal polynomial is x³ - 2, irreducible. The other roots are complex. Since they aren't in Q[2^{1/3}], the only automorphism is the identity. Therefore, Gal(Q[β]/Q) is trivial, i.e., the group of order 1. So the structure is trivial group.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Because in some cases, even if the extension is not normal, the automorphism group could be non-trivial. For example, take Q[2^{1/4}]. The minimal polynomial is x^4 - 2, and the extension is not normal. The automorphism group would have order 2, since there is an automorphism sending 2^{1/4} to -2^{1/4}, which is in the field. Wait, but in this case, the minimal polynomial x^4 - 2 factors as (x^2 - √2)(x^2 + √2) over Q[√2], but over Q, it's irreducible. However, in Q[2^{1/4}], √2 is in the field, so the polynomial factors further. But in our case, x³ - 2 factors as (x - β)(x² + βx + β²) over Q[β], but x² + βx + β² doesn't split further because the roots would require ω. So there are no automorphisms beyond the identity. Therefore, yes, the Galois group is trivial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if there was some hidden symmetry, but I don't think so. Let me recall that the Galois group of the splitting field of x³ - 2 is S_3, since the splitting field is Q[β, ω], which has degree 6 over Q. The Galois group is the symmetric group on 3 elements, since the polynomial is irreducible and the discriminant is -108, which is not a square in Q, so the Galois group is S_3. But in our case, since we are only looking at Q[β], which is a degree 3 extension, and the automorphism group is trivial. So the answer should be that the Galois group is the trivial group. So, structure is trivial, so Gal(Q[β]/Q) is isomorphic to the trivial group.\n\nBut wait, I just want to make sure that in the case of degree 3 extensions that are not Galois, the automorphism group can be trivial. For example, in the case of the splitting field of a cubic with discriminant not a square, the Galois group is S_3, but the intermediate fields may have different automorphism groups. Wait, but Q[β] is not a splitting field, so it's not normal. The automorphism group is trivial. So, yes, the conclusion is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe Galois group $\\text{Gal}(\\mathbb{Q}[\\beta]/\\mathbb{Q})$ is the trivial group, so the answer is \\boxed{\\{e\\}}."}
{"instruction": "Provide an example of an entire function $g$ such that $g(n) = 2n$ for all natural numbers $n$. An entire function is a function that is holomorphic over the entire complex plane.\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{{}}.", "output": "Okay, so I need to find an entire function g such that g(n) = 2n for all natural numbers n. Hmm, entire functions are holomorphic everywhere on the complex plane, right? So examples of entire functions include polynomials, exponential functions, sine, cosine, etc. But I need a function that specifically matches 2n at each natural number n. \n\nLet me start by thinking about polynomials. If I can find a polynomial that passes through all the points (n, 2n), then that would work. But polynomials are determined by their coefficients, and to pass through infinitely many points, unless it's a linear polynomial. Wait, if the function is linear, like g(z) = 2z, then certainly g(n) = 2n for all z = n. But hold on, is that possible? If I take g(z) = 2z, then yes, for any complex number z, g(z) = 2z, which is entire, and when z is a natural number n, g(n) = 2n. That seems too straightforward. Am I missing something here?\n\nWait, the problem says \"for all natural numbers n\". Natural numbers are positive integers, right? So the function g(z) = 2z is entire and satisfies g(n) = 2n for all n in natural numbers. So is the answer just g(z) = 2z? That seems too simple. Maybe the question is trying to trick me into overcomplicating it?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a non-polynomial entire function that also satisfies this condition. But according to the identity theorem in complex analysis, if two holomorphic functions agree on a set with a limit point in their domain, then they agree everywhere on the domain. Since the natural numbers are discrete and don't have a limit point in the complex plane, there are infinitely many entire functions that can agree on the natural numbers. So in this case, g(z) = 2z is one such function, but there could be others.\n\nBut the problem asks for an example, so the simplest one is probably g(z) = 2z. Let me verify that. Let's check g(1) = 2*1 = 2, g(2) = 4, etc., which matches 2n. And since g(z) = 2z is a linear function, it's entire because polynomials are entire. So is that the answer?\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider if there are other functions. For example, could we have something like g(z) = 2z + sin(πz)? Then at integer values z = n, sin(πn) = 0, so g(n) = 2n + 0 = 2n. But sin(πz) is also entire, so 2z + sin(πz) is entire. So that's another function satisfying the condition. But the problem says \"provide an example\", so they might just want the simplest one, which is 2z.\n\nBut maybe the question expects me to use the identity theorem. Since 2z is entire and agrees with the desired function on the natural numbers, but since the natural numbers don't have a limit point, there are infinitely many entire functions that can satisfy g(n)=2n. But to give an example, the most straightforward is g(z)=2z. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question. Let me check if 2z is the only such entire function. If two entire functions agree on the natural numbers, do they have to be the same? The identity theorem requires that they agree on a set with a limit point in the domain. Since the natural numbers are isolated points, there's no limit point in the complex plane. Therefore, uniqueness doesn't hold here. So indeed, there are infinitely many entire functions satisfying g(n) = 2n for all natural numbers n. \n\nBut the problem just asks for an example. So the simplest example is g(z) = 2z. Alternatively, if they wanted a different example, maybe with some periodic function added, but since they didn't specify any other conditions, the most straightforward answer is probably 2z.\n\nWait, but let me confirm that. Let's take another example: g(z) = 2z + e^{z} \\cdot \\sin(\\pi z). Then at z = n, sin(πn) = 0, so g(n) = 2n. And this function is entire because it's a combination of entire functions. So that's another example. But since the problem asks for \"an example\", either of these would work. But the simplest possible is just 2z.\n\nIs there a reason to think that 2z might not be the answer? For instance, maybe the problem is stated in a way that requires more thought. If the question had said \"for all integers n\", then 2z would still work, but here it's just natural numbers. But even so, 2z is entire and satisfies the condition. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had required the function to agree on non-integer points or something else, but no. So I think the answer is indeed g(z) = 2z.\n\nWait, but just to make sure, let's check the function 2z. Let me test it with n=1,2,3,... So 2*1=2, 2*2=4, 2*3=6, etc. Which is exactly what the problem requires. And 2z is entire because it's a polynomial, and all polynomials are entire. So that checks out.\n\nTherefore, the example is g(z) = 2z. I think that's the answer. Maybe I was overcomplicating it by considering other possibilities, but the simplest solution is the right one here.\n\n**Final Answer**\nAn example of such an entire function is \\boxed{2z}."}

Hmm, that means D is the first quadrant, right? So x is from 0 to infinity and y is from 0 to infinity? Wait, but actually, the problem didn't specify if it's over the entire first quadrant or a finite region. Let me check the original problem again. It just says \"bounded by the positive x and y axes.\" Hmm, usually when they say that, unless specified otherwise, it might be the entire first quadrant. But maybe I should confirm. If it's the entire first quadrant, then the limits would be from 0 to infinity for both x and y. But maybe it's a finite region? Wait, the integrand is \\( e^{-(x^2 + y^2)} \\), which decays rapidly as x and y get large, so the integral over the entire first quadrant would converge. So probably it's the entire first quadrant. \n\nAlternatively, sometimes regions bounded by axes could be a specific area, like a quarter circle or something.

Let me proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo the integral is \\( \\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-(x^2 + y^2)} dx dy \\). Since the integrand is a product of a function of x and a function of y, I can maybe convert this into polar coordinates. Wait, but polar coordinates would be good if the region is circular, but here it's a quarter-plane. But maybe even so, switching to polar coordinates is still feasible. Let's see.\n\nIn polar coordinates, x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ, and the Jacobian determinant is r. The region D is the first quadrant, so θ goes from 0 to π/2, and r goes from 0 to infinity. So then the integral becomes \\( \\int_{0}^{\\pi/2} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-r^2} r dr dθ \\).\n\nWait, that seems manageable. Let's check: when changing variables, the area element dx dy becomes r dr dθ, and x^2 + y^2 becomes r^2. So yes, the integrand becomes e^{-r^2} times r. Then, the integral over θ is from 0 to π/2, which is just π/2. Then the integral over r is from 0 to ∞ of e^{-r^2} r dr.\n\nHmm, the integral over r: let me compute that. Let’s make a substitution. Let u = r^2, then du = 2r dr, so (1/2) du = r dr. Then, the integral becomes (1/2) ∫_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-u} du = (1/2)( -e^{-u} evaluated from 0 to ∞ ) = (1/2)(0 - (-1)) = 1/2. So the integral over r is 1/2, and then multiplied by the integral over θ, which is π/2. So the total integral is (π/2)*(1/2) = π/4. \n\nWait, but let me verify if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe I can recall that the integral over the entire plane of e^{-(x^2 + y^2)} dx dy is π. Because switching to polar coordinates, the integral becomes ∫₀^{2π} ∫₀^∞ e^{-r^2} r dr dθ = 2π * (1/2) = π. Therefore, the integral over the entire plane is π, so the integral over the first quadrant, which is 1/4 of the plane, should be π/4. That matches. So yes, the answer is π/4.\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't remember the Gaussian integral, I could compute the double integral by recognizing that it's separable into the product of two single integrals. Since e^{-(x^2 + y^2)} = e^{-x^2} * e^{-y^2}, so the double integral is (∫₀^∞ e^{-x^2} dx) * (∫₀^∞ e^{-y^2} dy) ) = (∫₀^∞ e^{-t^2} dt)^2. But the integral ∫₀^∞ e^{-t^2} dt is known to be √π / 2. Therefore, squaring that gives ( (√π / 2 ) )^2 = π / 4. So that's another way to get the same result.\n\nSo both methods confirm that the integral is π/4. Therefore, the answer should be π/4. Let me check once more to ensure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nWait, when I converted to polar coordinates, the limits for θ were from 0 to π/2, which is correct for the first quadrant. The Jacobian was included as r, so that's right. The substitution for u = r^2 was handled correctly. Alternatively, by separating the integrals, each single integral is (√π)/2, so their product is π/4. Yep, that seems consistent.\n\nI think that's solid. So the answer is π divided by 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the integral is \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\pi}{4}}."}

The examples given are \\( G_2 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\) and \\( G_3 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\). Hmm, let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the terms. An abelian group that is a cubic over \\( \\mathbb{C} \\). Wait, cubic over \\( \\mathbb{C} \\)—that might mean a 3-dimensional abelian variety over the complex numbers? Because in algebraic geometry, an abelian variety of dimension 1 is an elliptic curve, and higher dimensions are abelian varieties. Since it's specified as cubic, maybe that's referring to dimension 3? But I should verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"cubic\" here refers to the group being 3-torsion or something else? But the examples given are for \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( n = 3 \\), with the subgroups being \\( \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_2 \\) and \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_3 \\).

So if the group is 3-dimensional, but the torsion subgroups are 2-dimensional? That seems a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the term \"cubic\" is being used differently. Let me check the original problem again. It says \"abelian group \\( G \\) that is a cubic over \\( \\mathbb{C} \\).\" Maybe \"cubic\" here refers to the group law being defined by a cubic equation? But abelian varieties of dimension 1 (elliptic curves) are defined by cubic equations, but higher-dimensional abelian varieties aren't typically embedded in projective space by cubic equations. Alternatively, maybe it's a group structure on a cubic curve? But a cubic curve is an elliptic curve, which is 1-dimensional.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a mistranslation or misstatement in the problem. Alternatively, maybe \"cubic\" here is referring to the group having exponent 3? But exponent 3 would mean every element satisfies 3x = 0, but the example given has elements of order 2 as well. Wait, the examples show that for n=2, the 2-torsion is order 4, and for n=3, the 3-torsion is order 9. So perhaps the group is 2-dimensional? Since for an abelian variety of dimension g, the n-torsion subgroup is isomorphic to \\( (\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z})^{2g} \\). So if \\( G_2 \\cong \\mathbb{Z}_2^2 \\), that would imply \\( 2g = 2 \\), so g = 1. But then for n=3, it would be \\( \\mathbb{Z}_3^2 \\), which is also 2g=2, so g=1. But the problem says it's a cubic over \\( \\mathbb{C} \\), which would be an elliptic curve (g=1). But then why is it called cubic? Because elliptic curves are cubic curves. So maybe \"cubic\" here is meaning an elliptic curve, i.e., a 1-dimensional abelian variety defined by a cubic equation. Then the torsion subgroups \\( G_n \\) would be \\( \\mathbb{Z}_n \\oplus \\mathbb{Z}_n \\), so their order is \\( n^2 \\). But in the problem statement, they give examples for n=2 and n=3, which match that. So the general pattern would be that the order of \\( G_n \\) is \\( n^2 \\).\n\nBut the problem says \"abelian group \\( G \\) that is a cubic over \\( \\mathbb{C} \\)\", so perhaps they mean an elliptic curve, which is a 1-dimensional abelian variety, and in that case, for each n, the n-torsion subgroup is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z}_n \\times \\mathbb{Z}_n \\), hence order \\( n^2 \\). So the general pattern is that the order of \\( G_n \\) is \\( n^2 \\).\n\nBut wait, the problem mentions \"cubic\", which makes me think of a 3-dimensional object, but in algebraic geometry, a cubic is a curve defined by a cubic equation, which is 1-dimensional. So maybe \"cubic\" here is a mistranslation or misnomer for \"elliptic curve\". Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to the group being 3-dimensional, but in that case, the torsion subgroup would be \\( (\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z})^{6} \\), since for an abelian variety of dimension g, the n-torsion is \\( (\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z})^{2g} \\). So if it's 3-dimensional, then 2g=6, so the torsion subgroup would have order \\( n^6 \\). But the examples given are \\( n^2 \\), so that would suggest g=1. Therefore, I think the problem is referring to an elliptic curve, which is a 1-dimensional abelian variety (a cubic curve), so the torsion subgroup \\( G_n \\) has order \\( n^2 \\).\n\nTherefore, the general pattern is that for each natural number n, the order of \\( G_n \\) is \\( n^2 \\). So the answer should be \\( |G_n| = n^2 \\), hence the order is the square of n.\n\nBut let me check with another example. For n=4, if G is an elliptic curve over \\( \\mathbb{C} \\), then the 4-torsion subgroup is \\( \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_4 \\), which has order 16, which is 4 squared. Similarly, for n=5, it would be 25. So yes, this seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the group is the additive group \\( \\mathbb{C} \\) modulo a lattice. If G is \\( \\mathbb{C} \\) modulo a lattice \\( \\Lambda \\), which is an elliptic curve, then the n-torsion points are \\( \\frac{1}{n}\\Lambda / \\Lambda \\), which is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z}_n \\times \\mathbb{Z}_n \\), hence order \\( n^2 \\). So this supports the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the general pattern is that the order of \\( G_n \\) is \\( n^2 \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe order of \\( G_n \\) is \\boxed{n^2}."}
{"instruction": "Provide an example of an infinite field in which the Frobenius endomorphism, defined by the $p$-th power map $x \\mapsto x^p$, is not surjective.\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{{}}.", "output": "Okay, so I need to find an example of an infinite field where the Frobenius endomorphism, which is the map that sends every element x to x^p, isn't surjective. Hmm. Let me recall what the Frobenius endomorphism is. It's a function defined on a field of characteristic p (where p is a prime number) that raises each element to the pth power. This map is always a ring homomorphism, and since we're dealing with fields, it's an endomorphism. But when is it not surjective? \n\nFirst, I remember that in a finite field of characteristic p, the Frobenius endomorphism is actually an automorphism. That means it's bijective, so it's both injective and surjective. For example, the field with p elements, GF(p), has Frobenius map being the identity function since x^p = x for all x in GF(p) by Fermat's little theorem. Similarly, in GF(p^n), the Frobenius map generates the Galois group of the field extension over GF(p). So finite fields are out because their Frobenius maps are surjective.\n\nTherefore, the example must be an infinite field of characteristic p. Let me think about some infinite fields of characteristic p. The first example that comes to mind is the field of rational functions over GF(p), like GF(p)(t), which is the field of fractions of the polynomial ring GF(p)[t]. That's an infinite field because there are infinitely many polynomials, and forming the field of fractions gives us a field where elements are ratios of polynomials.\n\nAlternatively, maybe an algebraic closure of a finite field? Wait, the algebraic closure of GF(p) is infinite, but isn't the Frobenius map surjective there? Hmm. Let me check. In the algebraic closure of GF(p), every element is algebraic over GF(p), and the Frobenius map is an automorphism. Wait, is that true? No, actually, in the algebraic closure, the Frobenius map is still injective because fields have no nontrivial ideals, hence injective homomorphisms are injective. But is it surjective?\n\nWait, in an algebraic closure, for any element a in the algebraic closure, is there a b such that b^p = a? Since the algebraic closure is a perfect field, right? Because every algebraic extension of a perfect field is perfect. Wait, GF(p) is perfect because the Frobenius map is surjective in finite fields. Wait, but if we take the algebraic closure of GF(p), which is the union of all finite fields of characteristic p, then since each finite field is perfect, the algebraic closure should also be perfect. So maybe the Frobenius endomorphism is surjective there. Therefore, that's not the example we want. So the algebraic closure is out.\n\nThen maybe an imperfect field? What's an example of an imperfect field? A field is imperfect if it is not perfect, which means that the Frobenius map is not surjective. So the example we need is an imperfect field. How do we construct such a field?\n\nWell, one way to get an imperfect field is to take a field of characteristic p and adjoin a transcendental element. For example, GF(p)(t), the field of rational functions in t over GF(p). Let's see why this might work. If we take t, an element of GF(p)(t), is there an element f in GF(p)(t) such that f^p = t? Let's check.\n\nSuppose such an f exists. Then f is a rational function, say f = g/h where g and h are polynomials in GF(p)[t], and h ≠ 0. Then f^p = (g^p)/(h^p) = t. So we have g^p = t h^p. Let's analyze the degrees of both sides. Since we're in characteristic p, raising a polynomial to the pth power just raises each coefficient to the pth power and exponents are multiplied by p. So, if g is a polynomial of degree d, then g^p is of degree dp. Similarly, h^p is of degree ep if h is of degree e. Then t h^p is a polynomial of degree ep + 1. Therefore, the left side is degree dp, and the right side is degree ep + 1. So we have dp = ep + 1. Then (d - e)p = 1. But p is a prime number, at least 2, so 1 is not divisible by p. Therefore, there are no integers d and e satisfying this equation. Hence, no such polynomials g and h exist. Therefore, there is no f in GF(p)(t) such that f^p = t. Therefore, the Frobenius map is not surjective on GF(p)(t). Therefore, GF(p)(t) is an example of an infinite field where Frobenius endomorphism is not surjective.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another example. What about the field GF(p)((t)) of formal Laurent series? That is also an infinite field of characteristic p. Let's check if the Frobenius map is surjective there. If we take a Laurent series, say a = t^{-1} + a_0 + a_1 t + a_2 t^2 + ... , can we find a b such that b^p = a? Again, trying to solve for b would involve taking the pth root of a Laurent series. But in characteristic p, the pth root would require that the exponents are divisible by p. For example, the coefficient of t^{-p} in b would have to be such that when raised to p, it gives the coefficient of t^{-1} in a, but p times the exponent in b would have to be the exponent in a. So if we have a term like t^{-1} in a, to get that from b^p, we need a term in b with exponent -1/p, which is not an integer. Therefore, again, the pth root would not exist in the Laurent series field, so Frobenius is not surjective there either. But GF(p)((t)) is also an example, but GF(p)(t) is perhaps simpler.\n\nAlternatively, maybe even a more straightforward example: take the field GF(p)(t) and consider its subfield consisting of elements fixed by Frobenius. Wait, but that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe another construction, but I think GF(p)(t) is the standard example here.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is the field of rational functions over GF(p), which is GF(p)(t). Let me just verify once again.\n\nSuppose F is a field of characteristic p, and consider the Frobenius endomorphism φ: F → F given by φ(x) = x^p. Then φ is surjective if and only if every element of F is a pth power. In the case of F = GF(p)(t), we have that t is not a pth power. Suppose t = f^p for some f ∈ GF(p)(t). Then f would be a rational function, so f = g/h where g, h ∈ GF(p)[t] are coprime polynomials. Then f^p = g^p / h^p. So t = g^p / h^p implies that t h^p = g^p. But as before, in GF(p)[t], the equation t h^p = g^p would require that in the polynomial ring, which is a UFD, the left side has a term with t, which is degree 1 + p*deg(h), and the right side has degree p*deg(g). Therefore, 1 + p*deg(h) = p*deg(g). Rearranged, 1 = p(deg(g) - deg(h)). Since p is at least 2 and the right-hand side is a multiple of p, 1 cannot be a multiple of p. Therefore, this is impossible. Thus, t is not a pth power in GF(p)(t), so φ is not surjective.\n\nTherefore, GF(p)(t) is indeed an example. So the answer is the field of rational functions over GF(p), which is written as GF(p)(t) or sometimes F_p(t).\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\mathbb{F}_p(t)}"}
{"instruction": "Consider a graph G9 with 9 distinct vertices.

Hmm, a triangle is three vertices where each pair is connected by an edge. Let me think. First, I remember that a triangle in graph theory terms is a complete subgraph of three vertices. So, the question is essentially asking how many such subgraphs exist in graph G9. But wait, the problem doesn't specify whether the graph is complete or not. It just says \"a graph G9 with 9 distinct vertices.\" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. If it's any arbitrary graph with 9 vertices, the number of triangles would depend on the number of edges present, right? But the problem doesn't give any specific information about the edges. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\n\"Consider a graph G9 with 9 distinct vertices. Determine the number of triangles that can be formed in this graph, where a triangle is defined as a set of three vertices with edges between each pair of vertices.\"\n\nWait, maybe I'm supposed to assume that G9 is a complete graph? Because in a complete graph, every pair of vertices is connected by an edge. So, in that case, the number of triangles would just be the number of combinations of three vertices, since all possible edges exist. But the problem doesn't explicitly state that the graph is complete. Hmm. This is a bit of a problem. If the graph isn't complete, the number of triangles could vary. So is the question missing some information? Or maybe in the original context, G9 is defined as a complete graph? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the maximum number of triangles possible in a graph with 9 vertices, which would be the case if the graph is complete. Because otherwise, without knowing the edge structure, we can't determine the exact number of triangles. Since the problem says \"can be formed,\" maybe it's asking for the maximum possible number. That would make sense. So if we assume that the graph is complete, then the number of triangles is just the combination of 9 vertices taken 3 at a time. Let me calculate that.\n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)). So here, n = 9 and k = 3. Let's compute that:\n\nC(9, 3) = 9! / (3! * (9 - 3)!) = (9 * 8 * 7 * 6!) / (3 * 2 * 1 * 6!) = (9 * 8 * 7) / (6) = (504) / 6 = 84. So there are 84 possible triangles in a complete graph of 9 vertices. Therefore, if G9 is a complete graph, the answer is 84.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"a graph G9 with 9 distinct vertices\" without specifying it's complete. If it's not complete, the number of triangles would be less. But since it's asking for the number of triangles that \"can be formed,\" maybe it's indeed asking for the maximum possible number, which is 84. Alternatively, maybe the question is in a context where G9 is a standard notation for a complete graph, but I'm not sure. In typical graph theory notation, K_n denotes a complete graph with n vertices. G9 might just be a graph with 9 vertices. Maybe the problem is from a specific textbook or context where G9 is defined as complete, but the user hasn't mentioned that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is from a competition or standard problem set where \"the number of triangles that can be formed\" in a graph with 9 vertices is interpreted as the number of possible triangles, i.e., the number of 3-cliques, which again depends on the edges. Without more information, we can't answer unless we assume the complete graph. Since the problem asks to \"Determine the number of triangles that can be formed in this graph,\" maybe the answer is 84, assuming the graph is complete.\n\nAlternatively, if the graph is empty (no edges), the number of triangles would be zero. But the problem doesn't specify. Hmm. Wait, maybe there's a different interpretation. Maybe it's asking how many triangles can be formed regardless of the edges, but that wouldn't make sense because a triangle requires edges. Wait, no. If the graph isn't specified, perhaps the question is ill-posed? But since the user is asking for a single number, probably 84, assuming the complete graph. Maybe the original problem is from a source where G9 refers to the complete graph. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach.\n\nWait, another way: the number of possible triangles in any graph is the number of combinations of three vertices that are all connected. So, if the graph is not specified, the answer could be variable. But since the problem is asking to \"determine the number of triangles that can be formed,\" perhaps it's a trick question where the answer is the number of possible triangles, which is C(9,3) = 84, regardless of the edges. But that doesn't make sense, because the number of actual triangles depends on the edges. Unless \"can be formed\" is interpreted as \"can potentially be formed if all edges are present,\" which would again be 84.\n\nAlternatively, if the graph is not complete, but we're supposed to count all possible triangles that exist given the edges, but since edges aren't specified, perhaps the answer is that it's impossible to determine without more information. However, the problem asks to provide a single number. Therefore, I think the intended answer is 84, assuming that G9 is a complete graph. Therefore, the number of triangles is the number of 3-vertex combinations, which is 84. So I think the answer is \\boxed{84}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{84}"}

Provide your answer as a single integer.\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{{}}.", "output": "Okay, so I need to find the order of the group GL₃(F₂), which is the group of all 3×3 invertible matrices with entries from the finite field F₂. F₂ is the field with two elements, 0 and 1, where arithmetic is done modulo 2. The question also mentions using a method similar to how the order of SL₂(F₃) was determined. Hmm, I remember that for SL₂(F₃), we considered the number of possible matrices with determinant 1, but maybe here for GL₃(F₂), the approach is to count the number of invertible matrices.\n\nFirst, let me recall that the order of GLₙ(F_q) is (qⁿ - 1)(qⁿ - q)(qⁿ - q²)...(qⁿ - q^{n-1}). So for GL₃(F₂), that would be (2³ - 1)(2³ - 2)(2³ - 2²). Let me compute that. 2³ is 8, so (8 - 1)(8 - 2)(8 - 4) = 7 * 6 * 4. 7*6 is 42, and 42*4 is 168. So the order is 168? But maybe I need to verify this using a method similar to SL₂(F₃). Let me think. How was SL₂(F₃) done? Probably by considering the possible columns of the matrix and ensuring linear independence.\n\nFor GL₃(F₂), we can think of building a matrix one column at a time, ensuring that each new column is linearly independent of the previous ones. So, the first column can be any non-zero vector in F₂³. Since F₂³ has 2³ = 8 vectors, and subtracting the zero vector, we have 8 - 1 = 7 choices for the first column.\n\nFor the second column, it needs to be linearly independent of the first. So, once the first column is chosen, the second column can't be a scalar multiple of it. Since we're over F₂, the scalar multiples are just 0 and 1. So, for any non-zero vector v, the only scalar multiples are 0*v = 0 and 1*v = v. Since the second column can't be 0 (as we need linear independence) and can't be equal to the first column. Wait, but if the first column is v, then the second column can't be in the span of v. The span of v is {0, v}. So, the second column must be not in {0, v}. There are 8 - 2 = 6 choices.\n\nThen, the third column must not be in the span of the first two columns. The span of the first two columns is a 2-dimensional subspace, which has 2² = 4 vectors. So, the third column can't be any of those 4 vectors. Therefore, there are 8 - 4 = 4 choices for the third column.\n\nHence, multiplying these together: 7 * 6 * 4 = 168. So that's the same as the formula. Therefore, the order of GL₃(F₂) is 168. So the answer is 168. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing anything here.\n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is that the determinant of a 3x3 matrix over F₂ must be non-zero. So, the number of invertible matrices is equal to the number of matrices with determinant 1, since in F₂, the only non-zero element is 1. So, the determinant must be 1. Wait, but actually, GL₃(F₂) consists of all matrices with determinant 1 or 0? Wait, no. Wait, determinant is in F₂, so the determinant can be 0 or 1. But invertible matrices are those with determinant 1. Wait, no, determinant is in F₂, and invertible matrices have non-zero determinant, which in F₂ is 1. So, yes, invertible matrices are exactly those with determinant 1. So, is the order equal to the number of 3x3 matrices over F₂ with determinant 1? But then, how does that compare to the count via columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the count via columns is more straightforward. Let me check again. The first column can be any non-zero vector: 7 choices. The second column can't be in the span of the first: since the span of the first column has 2 vectors (0 and the first column), so excluding those, 8 - 2 = 6 choices. The third column can't be in the span of the first two, which is a 2-dimensional space, so 4 vectors, so 8 - 4 = 4 choices. So 7*6*4 = 168. So that seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the total number of 3x3 matrices over F₂ is 2^(9) = 512. Then, subtract the ones that are not invertible. But that seems more complicated because you have to account for matrices with rank 0,1,2. But maybe using inclusion-exclusion. However, that might be more error-prone.\n\nAlternatively, recall that the order of GLₙ(F_q) is indeed the product formula. For n=3 and q=2, it is (2^3 -1)(2^3 -2)(2^3 -2^2) = 7*6*4 = 168. So, yes, 168. Therefore, the answer is 168. But let me verify with another approach.\n\nAnother approach is as follows: The number of invertible matrices is equal to the number of ordered bases of F₂³. Because each invertible matrix corresponds to a basis (the columns form a basis). So, how many ordered bases does F₂³ have?\n\nAn ordered basis is a sequence of three linearly independent vectors. The first vector can be any non-zero vector: 7 choices. The second vector can be any vector not in the span of the first: 6 choices. The third vector can be any vector not in the span of the first two: 4 choices. Hence, 7*6*4 = 168. So that's the same as before.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, the order is 168. Hence, the answer is \\boxed{168}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe order of the group \\( GL_3(F_2) \\) is \\boxed{168}."}

Hmm, let me start by recalling some properties of limits involving exponents and maybe logarithms. Often when dealing with expressions of the form f(x)^g(x), taking the natural logarithm can simplify things. But here, since the expression is already in a fraction, maybe I can rewrite it in a different way or compare the growth rates of the numerator and denominator.\n\nFirst, let's look at the denominator: (1 + 1/x)^(x^2). I remember that (1 + 1/x)^x approaches e as x approaches infinity. But here, the exponent is x^2 instead of x. So maybe I can express the denominator as [(1 + 1/x)^x]^x, which would be e^x as x approaches infinity? Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, no. Because (1 + 1/x)^x approaches e, but when you raise that to the xth power, you get something like e^x. But actually, the limit of (1 + 1/x)^(x^2) as x approaches infinity is e^{x}? That doesn't seem right. Because if you take the limit inside, you can't really do that here since both the base and the exponent are changing. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe taking the natural logarithm of the denominator would help. Let me denote the denominator as D(x) = (1 + 1/x)^{x^2}. Taking the natural log, ln D(x) = x^2 * ln(1 + 1/x). Then, maybe expand ln(1 + 1/x) using a Taylor series expansion. Since 1/x is small when x is large, so ln(1 + y) ≈ y - y^2/2 + y^3/3 - ... for small y. So here, y = 1/x, so ln(1 + 1/x) ≈ 1/x - 1/(2x^2) + 1/(3x^3) - ... Therefore, ln D(x) ≈ x^2*(1/x - 1/(2x^2) + 1/(3x^3) - ...) = x^2*(1/x) - x^2*(1/(2x^2)) + x^2*(1/(3x^3)) - ... = x - 1/2 + 1/(3x) - ... So as x approaches infinity, the higher order terms (like 1/(3x)) vanish, so ln D(x) approaches x - 1/2. Therefore, D(x) approaches e^{x - 1/2} = e^x / e^{1/2}. Therefore, the denominator behaves like e^x / sqrt(e) for large x.\n\nTherefore, the original expression is e^x divided by (e^x / sqrt(e)) = sqrt(e). Therefore, the limit as x approaches infinity is sqrt(e). So the answer should be sqrt(e), which is e^{1/2}, so boxed as \\boxed{\\sqrt{e}}.\n\nWait, but let me check this again because sometimes these approximations can be tricky. Let me verify by computing the limit of the logarithm of the original expression. Let me define L = lim_{x→∞} e^x / (1 + 1/x)^{x^2}. Taking natural log, ln L = lim_{x→∞} [x - x^2 ln(1 + 1/x)]. So compute this limit: x - x^2 ln(1 + 1/x). Let me expand ln(1 + 1/x) as before: 1/x - 1/(2x^2) + 1/(3x^3) - ... Multiply this by x^2: x^2 * ln(1 + 1/x) ≈ x^2*(1/x - 1/(2x^2) + 1/(3x^3)) = x - 1/2 + 1/(3x). Then subtract this from x: x - [x - 1/2 + 1/(3x)] = 1/2 - 1/(3x). As x approaches infinity, this tends to 1/2. Therefore, ln L = 1/2, so L = e^{1/2} = sqrt(e). So that confirms the previous result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using L’Hospital’s Rule? Let me see. If I rewrite the expression as e^x / e^{x^2 ln(1 + 1/x)} = e^{x - x^2 ln(1 + 1/x)}. So the exponent is x - x^2 ln(1 + 1/x), which we already found approaches 1/2 as x approaches infinity. Therefore, the entire expression approaches e^{1/2}.\n\nAlternatively, can we use substitution? Let me set t = 1/x, so as x approaches infinity, t approaches 0. Then the expression becomes e^{1/t} / (1 + t)^{(1/t)^2 * t^2} = e^{1/t} / (1 + t)^{1/t^2 * t^2} = e^{1/t} / (1 + t)^{1/t^2 * t^2} = e^{1/t} / (1 + t)^{1/t^2 * t^2}. Wait, that seems a bit convoluted. Maybe substitution complicates things here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the known limit that (1 + 1/x)^x approaches e as x approaches infinity. But in the denominator, it's (1 + 1/x)^{x^2} which is [(1 + 1/x)^x]^x, so as x approaches infinity, this would approach e^x. But then the original expression would be e^x / e^x = 1. But that contradicts the previous result. So there's a mistake here. Why?\n\nAh, because [(1 + 1/x)^x]^x is equal to (e)^{x} as x approaches infinity, but actually, the convergence of (1 + 1/x)^x to e is not fast enough. So even though (1 + 1/x)^x ≈ e - e/(2x) + ... So when you raise that to the xth power, (e - e/(2x))^x ≈ e^x * (1 - 1/(2x))^x ≈ e^x * e^{-1/2}, using the approximation (1 - a/x)^x ≈ e^{-a} as x approaches infinity. Therefore, the denominator is approximately e^x * e^{-1/2}, so the original expression is e^x / (e^x / e^{1/2}) ) = e^{1/2}, which matches our previous result. So that resolves the confusion. Therefore, the limit is sqrt(e).\n\nSo, through multiple methods, I get that the limit is sqrt(e). Therefore, the answer should be \\boxed{\\sqrt{e}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{e}}"}

Hmm, let's start by recalling what the Dirac delta function and the Heaviside step function are.\n\nThe Dirac delta function δ(z) is a generalized function that is zero everywhere except at z = 0, and it integrates to 1 over the real line. The Heaviside step function θ(z) is zero for z < 0 and one for z > 0. Their relationship is that the derivative of θ(z) with respect to z is δ(z). So, integrating δ(z) should give θ(z) plus a constant. But here, the argument of the delta function is ct - x, not just x or t. Let me think about that.\n\nFirst, let's consider the substitution. If I let u = ct - x, then du/dx = -1. So, integrating δ(ct - x) dx is the same as integrating δ(u) * (dx/du) du. Wait, but dx/du is -1, so it becomes integrating δ(u) * (-1) du. The integral of δ(u) du is θ(u) + C, so multiplying by -1 gives -θ(u) + C = -θ(ct - x) + C. But if it's an indefinite integral, the constant of integration could be absorbed, but typically for the Heaviside function, the constant is accounted for by the step. Wait, but maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, think about the definite integral from -∞ to x of δ(ct - x') dx'. Let me consider that. The definite integral of δ(ct - x') dx' from -∞ to x is θ(x - ct), because the delta function is located at x' = ct. So, if x > ct, the integral is 1, else 0. So that would be θ(x - ct). However, if we think about the indefinite integral, which is an antiderivative, then it would be θ(x - ct) plus a constant. But in the context of distributions, the indefinite integral is usually considered as θ(x - ct) because the constant is determined by the limit as x approaches -∞, which should be zero. \n\nBut wait, earlier substitution suggested -θ(ct - x). Let's check that. θ(x - ct) is 1 when x > ct, and 0 otherwise. Similarly, -θ(ct - x) would be -1 when ct > x, and 0 otherwise. But integrating δ(ct - x) over x should give a function that jumps from 0 to 1 as x crosses ct. Wait, that's exactly θ(x - ct). So maybe the substitution approach was wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps the substitution needs to account for the direction of integration. Let me re-examine that. If u = ct - x, then du = -dx, so dx = -du. Then, ∫ δ(ct - x) dx = ∫ δ(u) (-du) = -∫ δ(u) du = -θ(u) + C = -θ(ct - x) + C. But if we do the definite integral from -∞ to x, then it's ∫_{-∞}^x δ(ct - x') dx' = θ(x - ct). So here, the definite integral gives θ(x - ct), which is the same as the indefinite integral plus a constant. But according to substitution, the indefinite integral is -θ(ct - x) + C. Let's see if these can be equivalent. \n\nθ(x - ct) is equal to 1 - θ(ct - x), since θ(ct - x) is 1 when ct > x and 0 otherwise. So θ(x - ct) = 1 - θ(ct - x). Therefore, -θ(ct - x) + C can be equal to θ(x - ct) if C = 1. However, if we're talking about the indefinite integral, constants can be arbitrary. But in the context of distributions, perhaps we define the indefinite integral such that it tends to zero as x approaches -∞. So as x approaches -∞, θ(x - ct) tends to 0, and -θ(ct - x) tends to -1. Therefore, the correct one that tends to zero is θ(x - ct). So maybe the answer is θ(x - ct). \n\nAlternatively, let's think about differentiation. If the integral of δ(ct - x) dx is θ(x - ct), then differentiating θ(x - ct) with respect to x should give δ(ct - x). But wait, the derivative of θ(x - ct) with respect to x is δ(x - ct). However, δ(x - ct) is the same as δ(ct - x) because the delta function is symmetric. So δ(x - ct) = δ(ct - x). Therefore, differentiating θ(x - ct) gives δ(ct - x), which matches. Therefore, the integral of δ(ct - x) dx is θ(x - ct) + C. But if we take the constant as zero (as in the definite integral from -∞ to x), then it's θ(x - ct). \n\nBut earlier substitution suggested -θ(ct - x). However, θ(x - ct) and -θ(ct - x) differ by a constant. Specifically, θ(x - ct) = 1 - θ(ct - x). So, θ(x - ct) = -θ(ct - x) + 1. So, in terms of an indefinite integral, they are both valid, differing by the constant 1. But if we consider the physical meaning or the convention for the indefinite integral, which is supposed to be the antiderivative, then typically we can set the constant such that the function approaches zero as x approaches -∞. In that case, θ(x - ct) is the right answer because as x approaches -∞, θ(x - ct) approaches 0, whereas -θ(ct - x) approaches -1. Therefore, θ(x - ct) is the correct antiderivative if we want the constant to be zero at -∞. \n\nAlternatively, maybe in some contexts, the sign could be different based on the variable of integration. Wait, let's test with a specific example. Let c = 1, t = 0. Then δ(-x). The integral of δ(-x) dx is θ(x) because δ(-x) = δ(x), so integrating δ(x) dx gives θ(x). Wait, but δ(-x) is the same as δ(x), so integrating δ(-x) over x from -∞ to x would still give θ(x). But θ(x) is the same as θ(x - 0) when t = 0. So in this case, the integral is θ(x - ct) where ct = 0. \n\nAlternatively, if we take c = 1, t = 1, then δ(1 - x). The integral from -∞ to x of δ(1 - x') dx' is θ(x - 1). So that's θ(x - ct). So that seems to confirm that the integral is θ(x - ct). \n\nBut earlier substitution gave -θ(ct - x). However, θ(x - ct) = -θ(ct - x) + 1. So in reality, the two expressions differ by a constant. So, depending on the constant of integration, both could be considered correct. But when we talk about the indefinite integral in the context of distributions, we usually require that the antiderivative tends to zero as x approaches -∞. Since θ(x - ct) does that, while -θ(ct - x) tends to -1, θ(x - ct) is the correct answer. \n\nAnother way to see this: suppose we do a substitution y = ct - x. Then dy = -dx, so dx = -dy. Then ∫ δ(y) (-dy) = -θ(y) + C = -θ(ct - x) + C. If we set the constant C = 1, then it becomes 1 - θ(ct - x) = θ(x - ct). So the indefinite integral is -θ(ct - x) + C, and by choosing C = 1, we get θ(x - ct). So depending on the constant, both are related. But in the context of the question, which is asking whether it's -θ(ct - x) or θ(x - ct), and since indefinite integrals are only defined up to a constant, but in distribution theory, when we talk about antiderivatives, we usually fix the constant by requiring the limit as x approaches -∞ to be zero. Therefore, θ(x - ct) is the correct answer. \n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of δ(ct - x) with respect to x is θ(x - ct). \n\n**Final Answer**\nThe indefinite integral is \\boxed{\\theta(x - ct)}."}

Hmm, contour integrals... I remember that for a simple closed curve, the integral of 1/(z - a) around it gives 2πi times the winding number, right? And if the point a is inside the contour, the integral is 2πi, otherwise zero. But here, the contour is an ellipse, not a circle. But the function is 1/z, so the singularity is at z=0. So I need to check whether the origin is inside the ellipse or not. If it is, then the integral should be 2πi. If not, zero. But the ellipse equation is x² + 2xy + 2y² = 1. Let me see if (0,0) satisfies this. Plugging in x=0, y=0 gives 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, which is less than 1. So the origin is inside the ellipse. Therefore, the integral should be 2πi. Wait, but maybe I need to verify more carefully. Maybe the ellipse is parametrized in a way that could affect the result?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should parametrize the ellipse and compute the integral directly. But that might be complicated. Let me recall that the integral of 1/z around any positively oriented, simple closed contour enclosing the origin is 2πi. So as long as the ellipse encloses the origin, which it does, since the origin is inside, the integral is 2πi. So is that the answer? Wait, but the ellipse here is given by x² + 2xy + 2y² = 1. Let me check if this ellipse actually encloses the origin.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should diagonalize the quadratic form to see the shape of the ellipse. The equation is x² + 2xy + 2y² = 1. Let me write this in matrix form: [x y] * [[1, 1],[1, 2]] * [x; y] = 1. To find the principal axes, I need to diagonalize the matrix. The eigenvalues will tell me the lengths of the semi-axes.\n\nFirst, find the eigenvalues of the matrix A = [[1, 1],[1, 2]]. The characteristic equation is det(A - λI) = (1 - λ)(2 - λ) - 1 = (λ² - 3λ + 2) - 1 = λ² - 3λ + 1 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation: λ = [3 ± sqrt(9 - 4)]/2 = [3 ± sqrt(5)]/2. Both eigenvalues are positive since sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236, so 3 - sqrt(5) ≈ 0.764 and 3 + sqrt(5) ≈ 5.236. Therefore, the ellipse has semi-major and semi-minor axes lengths determined by the reciprocals of the square roots of the eigenvalues. Wait, actually, the standard form after diagonalizing would be λ₁(x')² + λ₂(y')² = 1, so the semi-axes lengths are 1/sqrt(λ₁) and 1/sqrt(λ₂). Since both eigenvalues are positive, the ellipse is centered at the origin, right? Because there are no linear terms in the equation.\n\nTherefore, the ellipse is centered at the origin, and since the equation is x² + 2xy + 2y² = 1, which is a quadratic form, the ellipse is rotated but still centered at the origin. Therefore, the origin is inside the ellipse, and the integral of 1/z around this contour should be 2πi. So is that the answer? But maybe I should check if there's a pole at z=0, which there is, and since the origin is inside, the residue is 1, so the integral is 2πi times 1. So yes, 2πi.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe the ellipse is not simply connected? No, it's a simple closed curve. The ellipse is a single closed loop, traversed once counterclockwise. So the integral is indeed 2πi. Alternatively, if the ellipse did not enclose the origin, the integral would be zero. But since plugging (0,0) into the left-hand side gives 0 < 1, the origin is inside. Therefore, the answer is 2πi. But maybe I need to verify with another approach, such as using Green's theorem or parametrizing the ellipse?\n\nAlternatively, could I use the deformation theorem, which states that if two contours are homotopic in a domain where the function is analytic except at the singularity, then their integrals are equal. Since the ellipse can be deformed into a circle around the origin without crossing the singularity at 0, the integral would be the same as around the circle, which is 2πi.\n\nAlternatively, using complex analysis, the Residue Theorem tells us that the integral over a closed contour of a function is 2πi times the sum of residues inside the contour. Here, the only singularity is at z=0, which is inside the ellipse, and the residue there is 1. Therefore, the integral is 2πi*1 = 2πi. So regardless of the shape of the contour, as long as it's a simple closed curve enclosing the origin once counterclockwise, the integral is 2πi. Therefore, the answer is 2πi.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a catch here. The ellipse is given by x² + 2xy + 2y² = 1. Let me see if maybe there's a scaling or rotation that might affect the integral. If the ellipse were not centered at the origin, but it is centered here. So even if it's rotated, the integral still depends only on whether the origin is inside. Since the origin is inside, the integral is 2πi.\n\nAlternatively, parametrize the ellipse. Let me try to parametrize it. Since it's a quadratic form, perhaps using rotated coordinates. Let me consider diagonalizing the quadratic form. As before, the eigenvalues are (3 ± sqrt(5))/2. Let me denote λ₁ = (3 - sqrt(5))/2 ≈ (3 - 2.236)/2 ≈ 0.764/2 ≈ 0.382, and λ₂ = (3 + sqrt(5))/2 ≈ 5.236/2 ≈ 2.618. Then, the ellipse can be written in the principal axes as λ₁ x'² + λ₂ y'² = 1. Therefore, the semi-major axis is 1/sqrt(λ₁) ≈ 1.618, and semi-minor axis is 1/sqrt(λ₂) ≈ 0.618. So the ellipse is centered at the origin, rotated by some angle, but the important thing is that the origin is inside. So the integral over this ellipse of 1/z is 2πi.\n\nAlternatively, if I were to parametrize z(t) along the ellipse and compute the integral, but that seems complicated. Let me see. If I let z(t) = x(t) + iy(t), where x(t) and y(t) parametrize the ellipse. Then, dz = x'(t)dt + iy'(t)dt, and 1/z dz would be (x'(t) + iy'(t))/(x(t) + iy(t)) dt. Integrating this over t from 0 to 2π (assuming a periodic parametrization). But this seems messy. Alternatively, perhaps use Green's theorem in complex plane?\n\nWait, Green's theorem can relate complex integrals to real integrals. The integral of f(z)dz can be written in terms of real and imaginary parts. Let me recall that for f(z) = u + iv, dz = dx + idy, so the integral becomes ∫(u dx - v dy) + i∫(u dy + v dx). Then, Green's theorem relates these to double integrals over the enclosed region. But in complex analysis, if f(z) is analytic, then the integral only depends on the singularities inside. Since 1/z is analytic except at z=0, which is inside the contour, the integral is 2πi regardless of the contour shape, as long as it's a simple closed curve enclosing the origin once. So this should confirm that the answer is 2πi.\n\nTherefore, after all these considerations, I think the integral is 2πi. Let me just double-check. If the ellipse didn't enclose the origin, then the integral would be zero, but we saw that the origin is inside. So yes, the answer is 2πi.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the contour integral is \\boxed{2\\pi i}."}

Hmm, let me think. First, I remember that the gamma function generalizes the factorial, but it's defined for complex numbers except the non-positive integers. Wait, but -1/2 is a negative half-integer, right? So maybe it's defined there? Or is there a problem with poles or something?\n\nWait, actually, the gamma function has poles at non-positive integers (0, -1, -2, ...), but -1/2 is not an integer, so maybe it's okay. Let me check. The gamma function Γ(k) has singularities at k = 0, -1, -2, ..., so Γ(-1/2) should be defined. But how do I compute it?\n\nThe integral definition is Γ(k) = ∫₀^∞ t^{k-1} e^{-t} dt. For k = -1/2, that becomes Γ(-1/2) = ∫₀^∞ t^{-3/2} e^{-t} dt. Wait, t^{-3/2} is 1/t^{3/2}, which goes to infinity as t approaches 0. So the integral might be divergent? But the gamma function is supposed to be defined for negative non-integer arguments through analytic continuation. Maybe I can't compute it directly from the integral definition? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the recursive property of the gamma function: Γ(k + 1) = k Γ(k). So if I rearrange that, Γ(k) = Γ(k + 1)/k. Let's try applying that here. For k = -1/2, Γ(-1/2) = Γ(-1/2 + 1)/(-1/2) = Γ(1/2)/(-1/2). I know Γ(1/2) is √π. So Γ(-1/2) = √π / (-1/2) = -2√π. So is that the answer?\n\nWait, but the integral definition seems problematic because the integral diverges. So how does that reconcile with the answer from the recursive relation? Maybe the integral definition is only valid for Re(k) > 0, and for other values, we have to use analytic continuation via the recursive formula?\n\nLet me verify that. The integral Γ(k) = ∫₀^∞ t^{k-1} e^{-t} dt converges only when Re(k) > 0. For Re(k) ≤ 0, we need to extend it using analytic continuation. So for k = -1/2, which has Re(k) = -1/2 < 0, the integral doesn't converge, so we have to use the recursive relation Γ(k) = Γ(k + 1)/k. Therefore, Γ(-1/2) = Γ(1/2)/(-1/2) = (√π)/(-1/2) = -2√π.\n\nBut just to make sure, let me check another recursive step. Let's start from a known value. For example, Γ(1/2) = √π. Then Γ(-1/2) = Γ(1/2)/(-1/2) = √π / (-1/2) = -2√π. Similarly, Γ(-3/2) = Γ(-1/2)/(-3/2) = (-2√π)/(-3/2) = (4/3)√π. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a reflection formula or something else? Wait, the reflection formula is Γ(k)Γ(1 - k) = π / sin(πk). Let's try that for k = -1/2. Then Γ(-1/2)Γ(1 - (-1/2)) = Γ(-1/2)Γ(3/2) = π / sin(-π/2). But sin(-π/2) = -1, so π / (-1) = -π. Therefore, Γ(-1/2)Γ(3/2) = -π. Now, Γ(3/2) is (1/2)Γ(1/2) = (1/2)√π. So Γ(-1/2)*( (1/2)√π ) = -π. Then Γ(-1/2) = -π / ( (1/2)√π ) = -π / ( √π / 2 ) = -2√π. Same result. So that confirms it.\n\nBut let me try to compute the integral numerically just to see. If I take Γ(-1/2) = ∫₀^∞ t^{-3/2} e^{-t} dt. Let's substitute variables. Let me set u = sqrt(t), so t = u^2, dt = 2u du. Then when t approaches 0, u approaches 0, and t approaches infinity, u approaches infinity. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ (u^2)^{-3/2} e^{-u^2} * 2u du = ∫₀^∞ u^{-3} e^{-u^2} * 2u du = 2 ∫₀^∞ u^{-2} e^{-u^2} du. Hmm, u^{-2} is 1/u^2, which still blows up at u=0. So the integral is divergent. So that confirms that the integral definition doesn't converge for k = -1/2. Therefore, we must use analytic continuation via the recursive formula or reflection formula.\n\nTherefore, the value is -2√π. Wait, but how does that make sense? The gamma function for negative arguments can be negative? Because Γ(k) for positive real k is always positive. But for negative non-integer arguments, it can be negative. For example, Γ(-1/2) is negative. Interesting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach is to use the analytic continuation via the integral. But how? Maybe using the continuation for the integral. Wait, sometimes people use the integral shifted by a certain contour or using the Hankel contour, but I don't know much about that. Alternatively, maybe using the integral representation involving the Mellin transform or something. But I think for the purpose of this problem, since the integral definition is given, but it's only valid for Re(k) > 0, and the question is to compute Γ(-1/2), so they probably expect using the recursive relation. So the answer is -2√π. Let me check with known values. For example, Γ(1/2) is √π, Γ(-1/2) is -2√π, which is consistent with the recursive formula. So I think that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the value of Γ(-1/2) is -2√π.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\( \\Gamma\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) \\) is \\boxed{-2\\sqrt{\\pi}}."}
{"instruction": "Determine the 4-torsion points of the elliptic curve $E: y^2 = x^3 - 5$ over the field of rational numbers $\\mathbb{Q}$.\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{{}}.", "output": "Okay, so I need to find the 4-torsion points of the elliptic curve E: y² = x³ - 5 over the rational numbers ℚ. Hmm, 4-torsion points are points P on E such that 4P = O, where O is the identity element (the point at infinity). So, these are points that when added to themselves four times, you get back to the identity. \n\nFirst, I remember that for an elliptic curve over a field, the torsion subgroup structure is given by the Nagell-Lutz theorem, which tells us that torsion points have integer coordinates, and their y-coordinates are either 0 or divide the discriminant of the curve. But wait, the Nagell-Lutz theorem applies to elliptic curves over ℚ with integer coefficients, right? Let me check the equation: y² = x³ - 5. This is in Weierstrass form, and the coefficients are integers (a=0, b=0, c=0, d=-5). So yes, Nagell-Lutz should apply here. \n\nBut before jumping into that, maybe I should recall the general structure of torsion subgroups. For elliptic curves over ℚ, the possible torsion subgroups are classified by Mazur's theorem. According to Mazur, the torsion subgroup can be either cyclic of order 1 through 10 or 12, or a product of two cyclic groups of order 2 and something else, but only up to order 4. Wait, specifically, Mazur's theorem says that the torsion subgroup is either cyclic of order 1 to 10 or 12, or isomorphic to C2 × C2, C2 × C4, C2 × C6, or C2 × C8. So 4-torsion points could be part of a cyclic group of order 4 or part of a product group C2 × C4. But I need to check if such points exist over ℚ for this specific curve.\n\nBut maybe it's simpler to use division polynomials. The 4-division polynomial would help in finding the 4-torsion points. Division polynomials are a way to find the x-coordinates of n-torsion points. The 4th division polynomial can be constructed from lower division polynomials. However, I might need to recall the exact formula for division polynomials. Alternatively, since 4-torsion points are also 2-torsion points of the 2-torsion points. Wait, 4-torsion points satisfy 2*(2P) = O. So maybe first find the 2-torsion points, then see which of them are divisible by 2 again?\n\nLet me first find the 2-torsion points. The 2-torsion points are the points P where 2P = O, which are exactly the points with y=0. So set y=0 in the equation: 0 = x³ - 5. Then x³ = 5. But 5 is not a perfect cube in ℚ, so the only solution would be x = ∛5, which is irrational. Therefore, there are no 2-torsion points over ℚ. That means the 2-torsion subgroup over ℚ is trivial. Hence, the torsion subgroup can't have elements of order 2, which suggests that there might be no 4-torsion points either? Wait, but 4-torsion points would have order 4, which implies that 2P would have order 2, but if there are no points of order 2, then there can't be points of order 4. So does this mean that the 4-torsion subgroup over ℚ is trivial?\n\nBut hold on, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's think again. If there are no 2-torsion points over ℚ, then the torsion subgroup can't have elements of order 2. Therefore, by Lagrange's theorem, the order of any torsion point must divide the order of the torsion subgroup. Since there's no 2-torsion, the torsion subgroup must have order coprime to 2. However, Mazur's theorem says that over ℚ, the possible torsion subgroups have orders 1-10, 12. So maybe the torsion subgroup is trivial or has order 3,5,7,9, etc. But 4 divides the order of the torsion subgroup only if the torsion subgroup has order 4, 8, or 12. But since there are no 2-torsion points, the torsion subgroup can't have elements of order 2, so 4,8,12 are out. Therefore, the torsion subgroup can't have elements of order 4. Therefore, the 4-torsion subgroup over ℚ is trivial. So the only 4-torsion point is the point at infinity.\n\nBut let me verify this with another approach. Let's try to use the division polynomials. For an elliptic curve in the form y² = x³ + ax + b, the 2-division polynomial is ψ₂ = 2y. So the 2-torsion points are those with ψ₂ = 0, which is y=0, as I found before. Since y=0 gives x³ =5, which is not rational, so no 2-torsion points over ℚ. Then, the 4-division polynomial is given by ψ₄, which can be constructed using ψ₂ and the other division polynomials. However, maybe this is getting too technical. Alternatively, since there are no points of order 2 over ℚ, there can't be points of order 4. Because if there were a point of order 4, then 2P would be a point of order 2. But since there are no points of order 2, there can't be points of order 4. Therefore, the 4-torsion subgroup over ℚ is trivial, consisting only of the identity element.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are points P where 4P = O, but P itself is not of order 4? Wait, no. If 4P = O, then the order of P divides 4. So the possible orders are 1,2,4. But since there are no points of order 2, the only possible orders are 1 or 4. But if there's a point of order 4, then 2P would be a point of order 2, which doesn't exist. Hence, there can be no points of order 4. Therefore, the only 4-torsion point is the trivial one, O.\n\nTherefore, the 4-torsion subgroup of E over ℚ is trivial, consisting only of the point at infinity.\n\nBut wait, let me check for possible errors. Suppose there is a point P of order 4 over ℚ. Then 2P would be a point of order 2, which must have y=0. But 2P would then have coordinates (x,0) where x is a root of x³ -5 =0. But x would have to be rational, which it isn't. Therefore, such a point P cannot exist. Hence, there are no non-trivial 4-torsion points over ℚ.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the multiplication-by-2 map. The multiplication-by-2 map on an elliptic curve can be described explicitly. If we take a point P and compute 2P, then if 4P = O, then 2P must be a 2-torsion point. Since there are no non-trivial 2-torsion points over ℚ, 2P must be O. But if 2P = O, then P is a 2-torsion point, but again, there are none. Hence, the only 4-torsion point is O.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the only 4-torsion point on E over ℚ is the identity element, the point at infinity.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe only 4-torsion point of \\( E \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\) is the point at infinity, so the answer is \\boxed{\\mathcal{O}}."}
{"instruction": "Evaluate the integral \\( \\int\\limits_{-\\pi/2}^{\\pi/2} \\cos(\\tan x)\\,dx \\).\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{{}}.", "output": "Okay, so I have to evaluate the integral from -π/2 to π/2 of cos(tan x) dx. Hmm, let me think. First, I remember that integrating trigonometric functions can sometimes be tricky, especially when they're composed with other functions like tan x here. Let me see. Maybe there's a substitution I can use, or perhaps some symmetry in the integrand?\n\nWait, the limits are from -π/2 to π/2, which is the entire period of tan x. But tan x has vertical asymptotes at -π/2 and π/2, right? So, the integral is improper because at x = -π/2 and x = π/2, tan x approaches negative and positive infinity, respectively. So, cos(tan x) as x approaches ±π/2 becomes cos(±∞). But cos of infinity doesn't converge, it oscillates between -1 and 1. Hmm, does that mean the integral might not converge? But the problem is asking me to evaluate it, so I guess it does converge. Maybe the oscillations cancel out due to the integral over symmetric limits?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a substitution that can make this integral more manageable. Let me try substituting t = tan x. Then, x = arctan t, and dx = dt / (1 + t²). But when x goes from -π/2 to π/2, t goes from -∞ to ∞. So, the integral becomes ∫_{-∞}^{∞} cos(t) * [dt / (1 + t²)]. Wait, is that right? Let me check:\n\nIf t = tan x, then dt/dx = sec²x = 1 + tan²x = 1 + t², so dx = dt / (1 + t²). Yes, that seems correct. So, changing variables, the integral becomes ∫_{-infty}^{infty} [cos(t) / (1 + t²)] dt. That looks more manageable. Now, the integrand is cos(t)/(1 + t²). Hmm, is this a standard integral?\n\nI recall that the integral of cos(t)/(1 + t²) from -infty to infty can be evaluated using complex analysis, like contour integration. But since this is a calculus problem, maybe there's another way? Alternatively, since the integrand is even, we can write it as 2 times the integral from 0 to infty of cos(t)/(1 + t²) dt. But I'm not sure how to compute that directly.\n\nWait, maybe using Fourier transforms or something? The integral ∫_{-infty}^{infty} cos(at)/(b² + t²) dt is known, right? Let me recall. Yes, I think that ∫_{-infty}^{infty} cos(at)/(b² + t²) dt = π e^{-ab}/b, for a, b > 0. Is that correct? Let me check with a=1 and b=1. Then the integral would be π e^{-1}. So, if that's the case, then here we have a=1 and b=1, so the integral is π/e. Therefore, the original integral would be π/e. But wait, let me verify this formula again.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider the integral ∫_{-infty}^{infty} e^{iat}/(b² + t²) dt. That's the Fourier transform of 1/(b² + t²), which is known to be π e^{-b|a|}/b. So, taking the real part, since we have cos(at), the integral would indeed be π e^{-b|a|}/b. So, for a=1 and b=1, it's π/e. Therefore, ∫_{-infty}^{infty} cos(t)/(1 + t²) dt = π/e. Therefore, the original integral is equal to π/e.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure that substitution was valid. When we did the substitution t = tan x, we transformed the integral from x from -π/2 to π/2 to t from -infty to infty. But cos(tan x) becomes cos(t), and dx becomes dt/(1 + t²). So, the integral becomes ∫_{-infty}^{infty} cos(t)/(1 + t²) dt, which by the formula is π/e. Therefore, the answer should be π/e. But is there another way to confirm this? Maybe through differentiation under the integral sign or some other method?\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't remember that formula, maybe I can compute the integral ∫_{-infty}^{infty} cos(t)/(1 + t²) dt by residues. Let's try that. Consider the complex integral ∫_{C} e^{iz}/(1 + z²) dz, where C is the contour consisting of the real axis from -R to R and the semicircle in the upper half-plane. For R > 1, the integral over the semicircle tends to 0 as R tends to infinity by Jordan's lemma. The residue at z = i (since 1 + z² = (z + i)(z - i)) is lim_{z→i} (z - i) e^{iz}/( (z + i)(z - i) ) = e^{-1}/(2i). Therefore, the integral is 2πi * residue = 2πi * e^{-1}/(2i) = π/e. Taking the real part, since the original integral is the real part of ∫_{-infty}^{infty} e^{iz}/(1 + z²) dz, we get Re(π/e) = π/e. Therefore, that confirms the result.\n\nThus, the original integral is π/e. Let me check if I messed up any substitutions. The substitution t = tan x is correct. The limits go from -infty to infty. The dx substitution gives dt/(1 + t²). So, everything checks out. Therefore, the value of the integral is π divided by e.\n\nBut let me just think again: the original integral is from -π/2 to π/2 of cos(tan x) dx. Since tan x is an odd function, and cos is an even function, so cos(tan(-x)) = cos(-tan x) = cos(tan x), so the integrand is even. Therefore, the integral is twice the integral from 0 to π/2 of cos(tan x) dx. If I do substitution t = tan x in that case, then when x goes from 0 to π/2, t goes from 0 to infinity, and dx is dt/(1 + t²). So, the integral becomes 2 * ∫_{0}^{infty} cos(t)/(1 + t²) dt. But we know that ∫_{-infty}^{infty} cos(t)/(1 + t²) dt = 2 ∫_{0}^{infty} cos(t)/(1 + t²) dt = π/e, so ∫_{0}^{infty} cos(t)/(1 + t²) dt = π/(2e), and then multiplying by 2 gives π/e. So, that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is π/e. Let me check with a numerical approximation. For example, if I approximate the integral ∫_{-pi/2}^{pi/2} cos(tan x) dx numerically. Let's compute it numerically for a rough estimate. Let's take x from -1.5 to 1.5 (since pi/2 is approximately 1.5708), but actually, we need to approach the asymptotes. So maybe using substitution to handle the improper integral.\n\nAlternatively, since we transformed it to ∫_{-infty}^{infty} cos(t)/(1 + t²) dt = π/e ≈ 1.1557. Let me check with Wolfram Alpha or something. Wait, I can't actually use external resources, but I can recall that yes, the integral of cos(t)/(1 + t²) over the entire real line is π/e. So, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be π divided by e, so π/e. Therefore, boxed, it's \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\pi}{e}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\pi}{e}}"}
{"instruction": "Provide an example of a sequence where every subsequence has a convergent subsequence, but the original sequence itself does not converge.\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{{}}.", "output": "Okay, so I need to find a sequence where every subsequence has a convergent subsequence, but the original sequence itself doesn't converge. Hmm, let me think. First, I remember that if a sequence is bounded, then by the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, every subsequence has a convergent subsequence. But if the original sequence doesn't converge, it must be that the sequence has multiple limit points or oscillates or something. \n\nWait, so maybe the sequence has two different subsequential limits. For example, a sequence that alternates between two different numbers. Like, say, 0 and 1. So the sequence would be 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, and so on. Let's check this. The original sequence doesn't converge because it keeps oscillating between 0 and 1. Now, take any subsequence. Since the original sequence only has two values, 0 and 1, any subsequence will also have infinitely many 0s or infinitely many 1s. So if a subsequence has infinitely many 0s, then we can take a sub-subsequence that is just all the 0s, which converges to 0. Similarly, if the subsequence has infinitely many 1s, then the sub-subsequence converges to 1. If the subsequence has both, then we can split it into two parts and take one of them. Wait, but how do we ensure that every subsequence has a convergent subsequence?\n\nAlternatively, maybe a more general example. If the sequence is bounded but has multiple limit points. For example, take a sequence that lists all the rational numbers in [0, 1]. But wait, that sequence is dense in [0,1], so every point in [0,1] is a limit point. But in that case, any subsequence would also be dense, so you could take a sub-subsequence converging to any point in [0,1]. But the problem is, does every subsequence have a convergent subsequence? Since the rationals are dense, but also by Bolzano-Weierstrass, any subsequence is in [0,1], so it has a convergent subsequence. So maybe that works. But the original sequence doesn't converge because it's dense. However, this example might be more complicated than needed.\n\nWait, but maybe the simpler example with alternating 0 and 1 works. Let's verify. Let the original sequence be a_n = (-1)^n. Wait, that alternates between -1 and 1. Then, the original sequence does not converge. Any subsequence of this will either have infinitely many -1s, infinitely many 1s, or both. If both, then we can take a sub-subsequence of either -1s or 1s, which converges to -1 or 1. If the subsequence only has one of them, then it's constant and converges. So yes, every subsequence has a convergent subsequence, but the original sequence does not converge. So maybe this works.\n\nWait, but the question didn't specify the space, but I assume it's in the real numbers with the usual topology. So in that case, (-1)^n is a valid example. But let me check if there are any subtleties. For example, suppose we take a subsequence that alternates as well. Wait, but even if you take a subsequence that alternates, say, take every other term starting from the first, which is just 1,1,1,..., which converges to 1. If you take a more complicated subsequence, like taking the first term, then the third, then the fifth, etc., which would be 1, -1, 1, -1,... again. But then, even this subsequence itself has a convergent subsequence. For example, take every other term of this subsequence, which would be 1,1,1,... or -1,-1,-1,... So yes, in this case, every subsequence has a convergent subsequence, but the original sequence does not converge. So that example works.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"every subsequence has a convergent subsequence\", which is true here. But is there a case where a subsequence might not have a convergent subsequence? For example, in a non-metric space? But the problem doesn't specify, so assuming real numbers with usual metric, this should be okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another example. Consider the sequence a_n = n if n is even, and a_n = 0 if n is odd. Then, the original sequence does not converge because the even terms go to infinity. But in this case, the subsequence of even terms itself does not have a convergent subsequence because it tends to infinity. Therefore, this example does not satisfy the condition. So that's bad.\n\nSo the key is that the original sequence must be bounded so that every subsequence is also bounded, hence by Bolzano-Weierstrass, every subsequence has a convergent subsequence. But the original sequence itself does not converge. Therefore, the example needs to be a bounded sequence that doesn't converge, but every subsequence can be broken down into a convergent sub-subsequence. So the alternating sequence between two numbers is the simplest such example.\n\nAlternatively, take a sequence where the terms get closer to two different limits. For example, a_n = 1/n for even n, and a_n = 1 - 1/n for odd n. Then, the even terms converge to 0, the odd terms converge to 1. The original sequence doesn't converge. Take any subsequence: if it has infinitely many even terms, then we can take a sub-subsequence converging to 0. If it has infinitely many odd terms, then sub-subsequence converges to 1. If it has both, then take either. So yes, every subsequence has a convergent subsequence, but the original sequence doesn't converge. That works too.\n\nSo both examples are valid. The alternating sequence is simpler, though. Let me confirm again with the alternating sequence. Take a_n = (-1)^n. Then, any subsequence must have infinitely many even terms, infinitely many odd terms, or both. If both, then we can extract a sub-subsequence of even terms (converging to 1) or odd terms (converging to -1). If the subsequence has only even terms, then it's constant 1. Similarly for odd terms. So yes, every subsequence has a convergent subsequence. But the original sequence does not converge. Therefore, this works.\n\nAlternatively, if we take a sequence like 0,1,0,1,0,1,... which is similar. So either 0 and 1 or -1 and 1. So both are examples. So I think the answer is the alternating sequence. The key is that the original sequence is bounded but not convergent, hence by Bolzano-Weierstrass, every subsequence has a convergent subsequence, but since the original has multiple limit points, it doesn't converge.\n\nTherefore, the example is the sequence (-1)^n, or any similar alternating sequence between two distinct numbers.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{(-1)^n}"}
{"instruction": "Provide an example of a finite, simple, undirected graph that is not $\\mathbb{R}^2$-realizable.\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{{}}.", "output": "Okay, so I need to come up with an example of a finite, simple, undirected graph that can't be realized in the plane. Hmm, let me recall what that means. A graph being ℝ²-realizable, or planar, is one that can be drawn in the plane without any edges crossing, right? So I need a graph that isn't planar. But wait, the question says \"not ℝ²-realizable,\" which I think is the same as non-planar. So, examples of non-planar graphs... I remember Kuratowski's theorem says that a graph is non-planar if it contains a subgraph that is a subdivision of K₅ or K₃,₃. So K₅ (the complete graph on five vertices) and K₃,₃ (the complete bipartite graph on three and three vertices) are the basic non-planar graphs. But the question asks for a finite, simple, undirected example, which both K₅ and K₃,₃ are. So maybe just one of those?\n\nWait, but maybe the question is expecting something else? Let me check. The user is asking for a graph that is not ℝ²-realizable, which means it can't be embedded in the plane. Since K₅ and K₃,₃ are the standard examples, maybe the answer is K₅ or K₃,₃. Let me confirm.\n\nFirst, K₅: it's a complete graph with five vertices. Each vertex is connected to every other vertex. The formula for planarity is related to Euler's formula: for a planar graph, the number of edges e ≤ 3v - 6 for v ≥ 3. Let's check that. For K₅, v = 5, so 3*5 -6 = 9. But K₅ has 10 edges. 10 > 9, so it violates the inequality, meaning K₅ is non-planar. Similarly, K₃,₃ is a bipartite graph with each partition having three vertices. For bipartite planar graphs, the formula is e ≤ 2v -4. For K₃,₃, v =6, so 2*6 -4 =8. But K₃,₃ has 9 edges, which is more than 8, so it's also non-planar.\n\nSo either K₅ or K₃,₃ would be valid examples. Since the question says \"an example,\" either should suffice. But maybe the answer expects one of them. Let me check if there's a simpler graph? Wait, but according to Kuratowski's theorem, those are the minimal non-planar graphs. Any other non-planar graph must contain a subdivision of these. So they are the simplest examples.\n\nBut wait, the question says \"finite, simple, undirected.\" Both K₅ and K₃,₃ are finite (5 and 6 vertices respectively), simple (no multiple edges or loops), and undirected. So they both fit the criteria. So either one is a valid answer. But maybe the answer is expecting K₃,₃? Because sometimes people use that as the standard example. Let me verify again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the utility graph, which is K₃,₃, is the typical example. But K₅ is also a standard example. Since the question allows any such graph, I can pick either. Let me check the problem statement again. It just says \"provide an example,\" so both are correct. However, perhaps the most commonly cited one is K₃,₃ because it's bipartite and might be slightly less obvious?\n\nWait, but in terms of edge count, K₅ has more edges relative to vertices. Let me think. For a simple graph, K₅ with 5 vertices, 10 edges. K₃,₃ has 6 vertices, 9 edges. Both exceed their respective Euler's inequalities. Either is a correct answer. Since the user hasn't specified any additional constraints, both are acceptable. However, since the problem says \"an example,\" I can just choose one. Maybe K₅ is more straightforward. Let me confirm once more.\n\nYes, according to standard graph theory, both K₅ and K₃,₃ are non-planar, and they are the minimal examples. So either is fine. Maybe the answer expects K₅. Let me check some references in my mind. In typical exams or problems, both are acceptable. But perhaps K₃,₃ is sometimes considered as the utility graph, which is the traditional example used in explaining non-planarity because of its connection to the three utilities problem.\n\nAlternatively, if the user wants a different example not necessarily the Kuratowski's ones, but I don't recall any other minimal non-planar graphs. All others are either planar or contain K₅ or K₃,₃ as a minor. So, I think K₅ or K₃,₃ are the answers here. Let me choose K₅ as the example. So the complete graph on five vertices is not ℝ²-realizable. Alternatively, K₃,₃. Let me check once again.\n\nWait, another way to confirm: the planarity of K₅. If I try to draw K₅ without crossings, is it possible? Let's see. Place five vertices around a circle. Each vertex connects to four others. When drawing the diagonals, eventually, you have to cross edges. For example, connecting each vertex to every other without crossings is impossible. Similarly, K₃,₃, the bipartite graph, if you have two sets of three nodes, connecting each node in one set to all nodes in the other set without crossings is impossible. So both are indeed non-planar.\n\nTherefore, either K₅ or K₃,₃ is a valid answer. Since the problem asks for \"an example,\" I can present either. Let me pick K₅. So the answer is the complete graph on five vertices, K₅. Alternatively, the complete bipartite graph K₃,₃. To be safe, maybe both? But the question says \"an example,\" so one is sufficient. Let me go with K₅. Final answer: K₅. But let me verify once again.\n\nYes, K₅ is a finite, simple, undirected graph, and it's not planar. Therefore, it's not ℝ²-realizable. So that's the example.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe complete graph \\( K_5 \\) is not \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\)-realizable. Thus, the example is \\boxed{K_5}."}
{"instruction": "Let \\( v \\) be a random unit vector in \\( \\mathbb{R}^3 \\). What is the expected length of the projection of \\( v \\) onto a given plane?\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{{}}.", "output": "Okay, so I need to find the expected length of the projection of a random unit vector in 3D space onto a given plane. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, a unit vector in ℝ³ means any vector v such that ||v|| = 1. A random unit vector means that the direction of v is uniformly distributed over the sphere. The projection of v onto a plane would be the component of v that lies on that plane. Since the plane is given, let's fix the coordinate system to make things easier. Maybe I can choose the plane to be the xy-plane without loss of generality because the vector is random and the sphere is symmetric. So, the projection of v onto the xy-plane would be (v_x, v_y, 0), right? The length of this projection is sqrt(v_x² + v_y²). But since the original vector is a unit vector, sqrt(v_x² + v_y² + v_z²) = 1, so the length of the projection is sqrt(1 - v_z²). Therefore, the length of the projection is sqrt(1 - v_z²), and we need to find the expected value of this quantity, E[sqrt(1 - v_z²)].\n\nAlternatively, since the projection can also be thought of as the norm of the vector's component on the plane, which is indeed sqrt(1 - v_z²). So the problem reduces to finding E[sqrt(1 - v_z²)] where v_z is the z-coordinate of a random unit vector.\n\nNow, since the vector is uniformly distributed over the sphere, the distribution of v_z is symmetric around 0. The coordinates of a random unit vector in 3D can be parametrized using spherical coordinates. Let me recall that in spherical coordinates, a unit vector can be expressed as (sinθ cosφ, sinθ sinφ, cosθ), where θ ∈ [0, π] is the polar angle from the positive z-axis, and φ ∈ [0, 2π) is the azimuthal angle. Since the distribution is uniform, the probability density function (pdf) for θ is (1/2) sinθ dθ, because the surface area element on the sphere is sinθ dθ dφ, and integrating over φ gives 2π, so the pdf for θ is (1/(4π)) * 2π sinθ dθ = (1/2) sinθ dθ. Similarly, φ is uniformly distributed over [0, 2π), but since we're dealing with the z-component and the projection onto the xy-plane, φ might not matter here because of symmetry.\n\nSo, the projection length is sqrt(1 - cos²θ) = sqrt(sin²θ) = |sinθ|. But since θ is between 0 and π, sinθ is non-negative, so the projection length is sinθ. Therefore, the expected value E[sinθ] is the integral over θ from 0 to π of sinθ multiplied by the pdf of θ, which is (1/2) sinθ dθ. Therefore:\n\nE[sinθ] = ∫₀^π sinθ * (1/2) sinθ dθ = (1/2) ∫₀^π sin²θ dθ\n\nHmm, let me compute this integral. The integral of sin²θ dθ over 0 to π is a standard integral. Recall that ∫ sin²θ dθ = (θ/2 - (sin2θ)/4) + C. Evaluated from 0 to π, the sin2θ terms will vanish because sin(0) = 0 and sin(2π) = 0. Therefore, the integral becomes [π/2 - 0] - [0 - 0] = π/2. Therefore, E[sinθ] = (1/2)(π/2) = π/4 ≈ 0.7854.\n\nWait, but hold on. Is that correct? Let me check again. The expected value of sinθ is (1/2) ∫₀^π sin²θ dθ. But ∫₀^π sin²θ dθ = π/2, so (1/2)*(π/2) = π/4. That seems right. So the expected length of the projection is π/4? Wait, but intuitively, if the vector is random, the average projection onto the plane should be something like the average of |sinθ|. But in this case, since θ is from 0 to π, sinθ is non-negative, so the average of sinθ is π/4. But let me verify with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to compute this expectation without spherical coordinates. Since the vector is uniformly distributed on the sphere, the distribution of v_z is symmetric. The pdf of v_z can be found as follows. For a unit sphere, the z-coordinate has a distribution such that the probability that v_z is between z and z + dz is proportional to the circumference of the circle at height z, which is 2π*sqrt(1 - z²). Therefore, the pdf f(z) is (1/2) * sqrt(1 - z²) * 2π / (surface area of the sphere)? Wait, no. Wait, surface area element in terms of z is 2π dz, because if you consider a height z, the circle there has circumference 2π*sqrt(1 - z²), and the width of the band is dz / sinθ, but maybe I need to think again.\n\nWait, in spherical coordinates, z = cosθ, so if we let z = cosθ, then θ = arccos z, and the differential dz = -sinθ dθ. Therefore, the surface area element when expressed in terms of z becomes 2π * |dθ/dz| dz. Since θ goes from 0 to π, z goes from 1 to -1, but since we're dealing with absolute value, the pdf of z is (1/(4π)) * 2π * sinθ * |dθ/dz| dz. Wait, maybe this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the standard result is that for a uniform distribution on the sphere in 3D, the marginal distribution of z (the cosine of the polar angle) is uniform in z over [-1, 1]. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the pdf of z is (1/2) for z in [-1, 1]. Wait, is that true? Let me think. If θ is the polar angle, then z = cosθ, and the pdf of θ is (1/2) sinθ dθ. Then, changing variables to z = cosθ, the pdf of z is (1/2) sinθ * |dθ/dz|. Since dz = -sinθ dθ, so |dθ/dz| = 1/sinθ. Therefore, the pdf of z is (1/2) sinθ * (1/sinθ) = 1/2 for z in [-1, 1]. So yes, z is uniformly distributed over [-1, 1]. Wait, that's interesting. So the z-coordinate of a random unit vector is uniform on [-1, 1]. Therefore, the expected value of sqrt(1 - z²) is ∫_{-1}^1 sqrt(1 - z²) * (1/2) dz. But since sqrt(1 - z²) is even function, we can compute 2 * ∫₀^1 sqrt(1 - z²) * (1/2) dz = ∫₀^1 sqrt(1 - z²) dz. And ∫₀^1 sqrt(1 - z²) dz is the area of a quarter circle with radius 1, which is π/4. Therefore, the expected value is π/4, which matches the previous result.\n\nTherefore, the expected length of the projection is π/4. Hmm, so both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring. But just to make sure, let me see if that makes intuitive sense. If you have a random vector on the sphere, the average projection onto the plane... If the vector is aligned with the z-axis, the projection is zero. If it's in the plane, the projection is 1. The average is π/4 ≈ 0.785, which seems reasonable, between 0 and 1. Alternatively, the average of |z| (the projection onto the z-axis) for a uniform distribution on the sphere is known to be 1/2. Wait, but here we're dealing with the projection onto the plane, which is sqrt(1 - z²). Since the average of sqrt(1 - z²) over z uniform in [-1,1] is π/4, which is about 0.785. So, yes, that seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, another way to compute the integral ∫₀^1 sqrt(1 - z²) dz is via substitution. Let z = sinφ, so when z=0, φ=0; z=1, φ=π/2. Then dz = cosφ dφ, and sqrt(1 - z²) = sqrt(1 - sin²φ) = cosφ. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀^{π/2} cosφ * cosφ dφ = ∫₀^{π/2} cos²φ dφ. Which is (φ/2 + (sin2φ)/4) evaluated from 0 to π/2. At π/2: π/4 + 0 = π/4. At 0: 0. So the integral is π/4, which matches. So that's another way to compute it.\n\nTherefore, all methods point to the expected value being π/4. Therefore, I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe expected length of the projection is \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\pi}{4}}."}
{"instruction": "Evaluate the integral: \\[ \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{e^{-x}}{\\sqrt{x}}\\ dx \\]\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{{}}.", "output": "Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral from 0 to infinity of e^(-x) divided by the square root of x dx. Hmm, let me think. First off, I remember that integrals involving e^(-x) and powers of x often relate to the gamma function. The gamma function is something like Γ(n) = ∫₀^∞ x^(n-1) e^(-x) dx. Wait, so if I compare that to my integral, which is ∫₀^∞ e^(-x)/√x dx, that's the same as ∫₀^∞ x^(-1/2) e^(-x) dx. So according to the gamma function formula, that would be Γ(1/2), right? Because n-1 = -1/2 implies n = 1/2. So Γ(1/2) is the value of this integral. But what's Γ(1/2) equal to?\n\nI think Γ(1/2) is the square root of pi. Let me verify that. Yeah, I recall that the gamma function at 1/2 is sqrt(pi). But maybe I should derive that to be sure. How can I compute Γ(1/2) directly? Let's see. Γ(1/2) = ∫₀^∞ x^(-1/2) e^(-x) dx. If I make a substitution here. Let me set t = sqrt(x), so that x = t², and dx = 2t dt. Then, when x is 0, t is 0, and as x approaches infinity, t also approaches infinity. Substituting into the integral, we get ∫₀^∞ (t²)^(-1/2) e^(-t²) * 2t dt. Simplifying the exponent: (t²)^(-1/2) is t^(-1), so multiplying by t gives t^(-1) * t = 1. So the integral becomes 2 ∫₀^∞ e^(-t²) dt. But I remember that the integral of e^(-t²) from 0 to infinity is sqrt(pi)/2. So multiplying that by 2 gives sqrt(pi). Therefore, Γ(1/2) = sqrt(pi). So the value of the original integral is sqrt(pi).\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any substitution mistakes. Let me try a different substitution just to verify. Let me consider the original integral ∫₀^∞ e^(-x)/√x dx. Let u = sqrt(x), so that x = u², and dx = 2u du. Then, substituting, we get ∫₀^∞ e^(-u²)/u * 2u du. The u in the denominator cancels with the u from the substitution, leaving 2 ∫₀^∞ e^(-u²) du. Again, the integral of e^(-u²) from 0 to infinity is sqrt(pi)/2. So 2*(sqrt(pi)/2) = sqrt(pi). Yep, same result. So that confirms it.\n\nAlternatively, if I recall that the Gaussian integral ∫₀^∞ e^(-t²) dt is sqrt(pi)/2, and through substitution, as shown, multiplying by 2 gives sqrt(pi). So Γ(1/2) is indeed sqrt(pi). Therefore, the integral in question is equal to sqrt(pi).\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't remember the gamma function, maybe I could use polar coordinates or another method. Let's see. Suppose I didn't know about the gamma function. Let me try to compute the integral directly. Let me denote I = ∫₀^∞ e^(-x)/√x dx. Let me make a substitution u = sqrt(x), so du = 1/(2√x) dx, which implies dx = 2√x du = 2u du. Then, substituting into the integral, I = ∫₀^∞ e^(-u²)/u * 2u du = 2 ∫₀^∞ e^(-u²) du. So I = 2*(sqrt(pi)/2) = sqrt(pi). So again, same answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using integration by parts? Let me see. Let me set u = 1/√x, dv = e^(-x) dx. Then, du = (-1/2)x^(-3/2) dx, and v = -e^(-x). So integration by parts gives uv| from 0 to ∞ minus ∫₀^∞ v du. So that's [-e^(-x)/√x] from 0 to ∞ + (1/2) ∫₀^∞ e^(-x) x^(-3/2) dx. Hmm, but evaluating the first term: as x approaches infinity, e^(-x) goes to 0, and 1/√x also goes to 0, so that term is 0. At x = 0, e^(-x) is 1, but 1/√x tends to infinity. So we have an indeterminate form here. Wait, actually, when x approaches 0, the term -e^(-x)/√x approaches -infinity. But the original integral ∫₀^∞ e^(-x)/√x dx is convergent at both limits? Wait, at x near 0, 1/√x is integrable, since the integral of x^(-1/2) from 0 to 1 is 2x^(1/2)| from 0 to1 = 2, which is finite. Similarly, as x approaches infinity, e^(-x) decays exponentially, so the integral converges. So the integration by parts approach might not be helpful here because the boundary term seems problematic. Let me check:\n\nWhen evaluating [-e^(-x)/√x] from 0 to ∞, as x approaches infinity, e^(-x) dominates, so the term is 0. As x approaches 0, e^(-x) ≈1, so we have -1/√x, which goes to -infinity. But the other part of the integration by parts is (1/2) ∫₀^∞ e^(-x) x^(-3/2) dx. Wait, but this seems like we're complicating things, because now we have an integral with x^(-3/2) which is more singular at 0. Hmm, maybe integration by parts isn't the right approach here. Let me abandon that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use substitution to relate it to the Gaussian integral. Let me try x = t^2. Then dx = 2t dt, so the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ e^(-t²)/t * 2t dt = 2 ∫₀^∞ e^(-t²) dt = 2*(sqrt(pi)/2) = sqrt(pi). So same result. So multiple methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the definition of the gamma function and its properties. For example, Γ(n) = (n-1)! for positive integers, but for half-integers, Γ(1/2) = sqrt(pi), Γ(3/2) = (1/2)sqrt(pi), etc. Since the problem is Γ(1/2), that's sqrt(pi). So, yeah, that's the answer.\n\nBut to make sure, let me compute this integral numerically as well. Let's approximate ∫₀^∞ e^(-x)/√x dx. Let me consider substitution x = y^2, as before, so the integral becomes 2 ∫₀^∞ e^(-y²) dy. The integral of e^(-y²) from 0 to ∞ is sqrt(pi)/2 ≈ 0.88622692545. Therefore, multiplying by 2 gives sqrt(pi) ≈ 1.77245385091. Let me check with numerical integration. For example, integrating from 0 to some large number, say 1000, of e^(-x)/sqrt(x). Let's approximate numerically.\n\nBut since I can't actually compute this right now, but I can recall that the integral of e^(-x^2) from 0 to ∞ is sqrt(pi)/2 ≈ 0.8862, so multiplying by 2 gives sqrt(pi) ≈ 1.77245. If I check with known constants, sqrt(pi) is approximately 1.77245385091... So that's the value. Therefore, the integral indeed equals sqrt(pi).\n\nTherefore, after verifying through multiple methods: substitution relating to the Gaussian integral, gamma function properties, and checking the steps for substitution, I can confidently say that the integral ∫₀^∞ e^(-x)/√x dx equals sqrt(pi).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the integral is \\boxed{\\sqrt{\\pi}}."}

I need to determine the order of the element (2, 3) + M in the quotient group ℤ²/M, where M is the subgroup defined by M = { (x, y) ∈ ℤ² | 4x + 7y ≡ 0 mod 28 }. Hmm, the order of an element in a quotient group is the smallest positive integer n such that n*(a, b) is in M, right? So I need to find the smallest n where n*(2, 3) = (2n, 3n) is in M. That means 4*(2n) + 7*(3n) ≡ 0 mod 28. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 4*2n + 7*3n. That's 8n + 21n. 8n + 21n is 29n. So 29n ≡ 0 mod 28. So 29n ≡ 0 mod 28. Since 29 ≡ 1 mod 28, this simplifies to 1*n ≡ 0 mod 28. So n ≡ 0 mod 28. That would mean the order is 28? But that seems high. Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check. If 29n ≡ 0 mod 28, then since 29 ≡ 1 mod 28, that becomes n ≡ 0 mod 28. So the smallest positive integer n is 28. Therefore, the order of (2, 3) + M in ℤ²/M is 28. But I need to make sure there's no smaller n where (2n, 3n) is in M. Let me verify that with n=14. Let's compute 4*(2*14) + 7*(3*14). 2*14=28, 3*14=42. So 4*28 +7*42 = 112 + 294 = 406. Then 406 mod 28. 28*14=392, so 406-392=14. So 14 ≡ 14 mod28 ≠0. So n=14 doesn't work. How about n=7? Let's check. 2*7=14, 3*7=21. Then 4*14 +7*21=56 +147=203. 203 divided by 28: 28*7=196, 203-196=7. So 7 mod28. Not zero. So n=7 also doesn't work. How about n=4? 2*4=8, 3*4=12. 4*8 +7*12=32 +84=116. 116 mod28: 28*4=112, 116-112=4. So 4 mod28. Not zero. n=2: 4*4 +7*6=16+42=58. 58 mod28: 58-56=2. Not zero. n=1: 4*2 +7*3=8+21=29. 29 mod28=1. Not zero. So seems like none of the divisors of 28 work except 28 itself. Therefore, the order is indeed 28. Wait, but I should check if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the quotient group ℤ²/M is isomorphic to some cyclic group or a product of cyclic groups, and maybe I can find its structure. Then the order of (2,3)+M would be the least common multiple of the orders in each component. But how to find the structure of ℤ²/M?\n\nAlternatively, since M is defined by 4x +7y ≡0 mod28. So M is the set of integer solutions (x,y) to 4x +7y =28k for some integer k. So M is generated by some basis. Maybe we can represent M as a lattice in ℤ², and then the quotient group ℤ²/M would be isomorphic to the determinant of that lattice or something? Wait, for lattices, the index of M in ℤ² is equal to the absolute value of the determinant of the generating matrix. But how is M generated?\n\nAlternatively, to find the quotient group, we can consider that M is the kernel of some group homomorphism from ℤ² to some cyclic group. Let's see. The equation 4x +7y ≡0 mod28. So we can define a homomorphism φ: ℤ² → ℤ/28ℤ given by φ(x,y)=4x +7y mod28. Then M is the kernel of φ. So by the first isomorphism theorem, ℤ²/M is isomorphic to the image of φ. What's the image of φ? The subgroup of ℤ/28ℤ generated by gcd(4,7,28). Wait, the image is generated by gcd(4,7) and gcd(4,28) and gcd(7,28)? Wait, maybe not. Let's think.\n\nThe image of φ is the set {4x +7y mod28 | x,y ∈ ℤ}. Since 4 and 7 are coefficients. The image is the subgroup of ℤ/28ℤ generated by gcd(4,7). Since 4 and7 are coprime, gcd(4,7)=1. Therefore, the image is all of ℤ/28ℤ. Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, if 4x +7y can generate any integer modulo 28. Let me check. For example, can we get 1 mod28? Suppose 4x +7y ≡1 mod28. Let's solve for x and y. Let me set x=2, y= (1 -4*2)/7=(1-8)/7= -7/7=-1. So x=2, y=-1. 4*2 +7*(-1)=8-7=1. So yes, 1 is in the image. Therefore, the image is indeed all of ℤ/28ℤ, so ℤ²/M ≅ ℤ/28ℤ. Therefore, the quotient group is cyclic of order28. Therefore, the element (2,3)+M has an order that divides28. But we need to check what's the order. Since the isomorphism is given by φ, which maps (x,y)+M to 4x +7y mod28. Therefore, the element (2,3)+M is mapped to 4*2 +7*3=8+21=29≡1 mod28. Therefore, under the isomorphism, (2,3)+M corresponds to 1 in ℤ/28ℤ. The order of 1 in ℤ/28ℤ is28. Therefore, the order of (2,3)+M is also28. So that confirms the earlier calculation.\n\nWait, that seems a different approach but arrives at the same conclusion. So the quotient group is cyclic of order28, and the element in question corresponds to a generator, so its order is28. So therefore, the answer is28. Is there a possibility I made a mistake here?\n\nWait, let's double-check. If φ is surjective, then ℤ²/M ≅ ℤ/28ℤ. So elements of the quotient group have orders dividing28. The image of (2,3) under φ is1 in ℤ/28ℤ, which has order28. Therefore, the order of (2,3)+M is28. So yes, this seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think about the element (2,3)+M. To find the smallest n such that n*(2,3) is in M. Which is equivalent to 4*(2n) +7*(3n) ≡0 mod28. Which is 8n +21n=29n≡0 mod28. 29≡1 mod28, so n≡0 mod28. Hence n=28. Therefore, order28.\n\nAnother way: if the quotient group is cyclic of order28, then the order of any element is28 divided by the gcd of the element's value and28. Since the element corresponds to1 mod28, gcd(1,28)=1, so the order is28/1=28. Therefore, same result.\n\nSo I think the answer is28.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe order of the element \\((2, 3) + M\\) in the quotient group \\(\\mathbb{Z}^2/M\\) is \\(\\boxed{28}\\)."}

Hmm, flux through a surface... right, that's the surface integral of the vector field over the surface. The formula for flux is ∫∫_S F · dS. But wait, the surface here is a closed cylinder, right? Because it's the entire cylindrical surface including the top, bottom, and the curved side. Wait, actually, the problem says \"cylindrical surface S = { (x,y,z) | x² + y² ≤ 9, 0 ≤ z ≤ 2 }\". So, that's the entire solid cylinder, including the top disk at z = 2, the bottom disk at z = 0, and the lateral surface where x² + y² = 9. So the flux through the entire closed surface. \n\nBut hold on, maybe they just want the flux through the lateral surface? Hmm, the problem says \"through the cylindrical surface\". Wait, sometimes \"cylindrical surface\" refers only to the curved part, but in the definition given here, S is the set of all points where x² + y² ≤ 9 and 0 ≤ z ≤ 2. So that's the entire solid cylinder, which is a closed surface. Therefore, when they say \"flux through the cylindrical surface S\", they might mean the flux through the entire closed surface. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and they just meant the lateral surface. Wait, let me check the original problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"Calculate the flux of the vector field F(x,y,z) = x i + y j + z k through the cylindrical surface S = { (x,y,z) | x² + y² ≤ 9, 0 ≤ z ≤ 2 }\". So S is defined as all points (x,y,z) where x² + y² is less than or equal to 9 and z is between 0 and 2. So that is the entire volume of the cylinder. But flux is through a surface. Wait, is there a confusion here between a volume and a surface? Because the set S as defined is a three-dimensional solid cylinder, not a surface. Therefore, perhaps the problem is misstated. Maybe they meant the boundary of S, which would be the surface of the cylinder, consisting of the top, bottom, and the curved side. Because flux is computed through a surface, not through a volume. So probably, even though they wrote S as the solid cylinder, they actually mean the surface of it. So the flux through the entire closed surface (top, bottom, lateral surface). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is referring to just the curved surface. Hmm. But to resolve this, perhaps the best approach is to compute the flux through the entire closed surface and see if that makes sense. Alternatively, check whether using the divergence theorem is applicable here, which would convert the flux integral into a volume integral over the cylinder. Let me recall the divergence theorem: the flux of F through a closed surface S is equal to the triple integral over the volume enclosed by S of the divergence of F. \n\nGiven that, if S is the closed surface, then we can compute the flux easily by computing the divergence of F and integrating over the volume. Let me check the divergence of F. The divergence of F is ∇·F = ∂F_x/∂x + ∂F_y/∂y + ∂F_z/∂z. So for F = x i + y j + z k, the divergence is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. So the divergence is 3, a constant. Therefore, by the divergence theorem, the flux through the closed surface S (the entire cylinder) is equal to 3 times the volume of the cylinder. The volume of the cylinder is πr²h. Here, r² = 9, so r = 3, and h = 2. Therefore, the volume is π*9*2 = 18π. Therefore, the flux would be 3*18π = 54π. So if the question is indeed asking for the flux through the entire closed surface, the answer is 54π. \n\nBut wait, the problem states \"the cylindrical surface S = { (x,y,z) | x² + y² ≤ 9, 0 ≤ z ≤ 2 }\". If S is the solid cylinder, then the flux through S isn't really defined unless they mean the boundary. So perhaps there was a mistake in the problem statement, and they meant the boundary of S, which is the surface of the cylinder. So in that case, using the divergence theorem is valid, and the answer is 54π. However, if they actually meant just the lateral surface (the curved part), then we would need to compute the flux through that part alone, and the answer would be different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can compute the flux through each part (top, bottom, side) and add them up. Let me try that approach as verification. For the flux through the top disk at z = 2, the normal vector is upward, so k. So F · n on the top is z component of F, which is z. At z = 2, that's 2. So the flux through the top is ∫∫_{top} 2 dA. The area of the top is πr² = π*9 = 9π. So flux through top is 2*9π = 18π. Similarly, the bottom disk at z = 0, normal vector is downward, so -k. So F · n is -z. At z = 0, that's -0 = 0. So flux through bottom is 0. Now, the lateral surface. Here, the normal vector points radially outward. For the lateral surface, parameterize it using cylindrical coordinates. Let's let x = 3 cosθ, y = 3 sinθ, z = z, where θ from 0 to 2π and z from 0 to 2. The normal vector can be found by taking the cross product of the partial derivatives of the parameterization. Let's parameterize the surface as r(θ, z) = 3 cosθ i + 3 sinθ j + z k. Then, partial derivative with respect to θ is -3 sinθ i + 3 cosθ j + 0 k. Partial derivative with respect to z is 0 i + 0 j + 1 k. The cross product of r_θ × r_z is determinant:\n\ni  j  k\n-3 sinθ  3 cosθ  0\n0        0       1\n\nCalculating determinant: i*(3 cosθ*1 - 0*0) - j*(-3 sinθ*1 - 0*0) + k*(-3 sinθ*0 - 3 cosθ*0) = 3 cosθ i + 3 sinθ j + 0 k. The magnitude of this vector is sqrt( (3 cosθ)^2 + (3 sinθ)^2 ) = 3. The direction is outward normal, which this cross product gives (since it's computed as r_θ × r_z, which for a cylinder parameterized this way, points outward). So the normal vector is 3 cosθ i + 3 sinθ j. So dS = (3 cosθ i + 3 sinθ j) dθ dz. \n\nNow, F on the lateral surface. F = x i + y j + z k. On the lateral surface, x = 3 cosθ, y = 3 sinθ, z = z. So F = 3 cosθ i + 3 sinθ j + z k. Then, the flux is ∫∫ F · dS over θ from 0 to 2π and z from 0 to 2. So F · dS is (3 cosθ)(3 cosθ) + (3 sinθ)(3 sinθ) + z*0 = 9 cos²θ + 9 sin²θ + 0 = 9 (cos²θ + sin²θ) = 9. Therefore, the integral over the lateral surface is ∫0^2 ∫0^{2π} 9 dθ dz = 9 * 2π * 2 = 36π. \n\nThen, adding up the fluxes: top (18π) + bottom (0) + lateral (36π) = 54π, which matches the divergence theorem result. Therefore, the flux through the entire closed surface is 54π. So even though the problem statement says \"cylindrical surface\", which might be ambiguous, since S was defined as the solid cylinder, but flux is through a surface, the answer is 54π. Alternatively, if the problem intended only the lateral surface, the answer would be 36π, but given that the divergence theorem gives the total flux through the closed surface as 54π, which matches summing the individual parts, and since S is defined as the solid, which is a closed surface, I think the answer is 54π. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 54π.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe flux of the vector field through the cylindrical surface is \\boxed{54\\pi}."}

In other words, it's the supremum of |T(f)| over all f with ||f||_∞ ≤ 1.\n\nSo, in this case, T(f) is the integral from 0 to 1 of t times f(t) dt. The norm on C[0,1] is the sup norm, which is the maximum of |f(t)| for t in [0,1]. The operator norm ||T|| would then be the supremum of |∫₀¹ t f(t) dt| where the sup is taken over all f with maxₜ|f(t)| ≤ 1.\n\nHmm, okay. So maybe I can think of this as a linear functional on C[0,1]. Since C[0,1] with the sup norm is a Banach space, and T is a linear functional, so it's a operator from C[0,1] to R. The operator norm for linear functionals can sometimes be found using the Riesz Representation Theorem, which says that every bounded linear functional on C[0,1] can be represented as integration against a signed Borel measure on [0,1]. But here, T(f) is given as an integral against the function t dt, which is a measure absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure with Radon-Nikodym derivative t. So in that case, the operator norm would be the total variation of the measure. Wait, but for positive measures, the total variation is just the measure of the whole space, right? So if the measure is t dt, then the total variation would be ∫₀¹ |t| dt. But t is non-negative on [0,1], so that integral is ∫₀¹ t dt = 1/2. But wait, that would mean the operator norm is 1/2. But is that correct?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the Riesz Representation Theorem says that the dual space of C[0,1] is the space of regular Borel measures on [0,1], and the norm of the functional is the total variation of the measure. But here, the measure is dμ(t) = t dt, which is a positive measure. For a positive measure, the total variation is just the measure of the whole interval, which is ∫₀¹ t dt = 1/2. So that suggests that ||T|| = 1/2. But is this correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it directly. Let's see. For any f with ||f||_∞ ≤ 1, we have |T(f)| = |∫₀¹ t f(t) dt| ≤ ∫₀¹ t |f(t)| dt ≤ ∫₀¹ t * ||f||_∞ dt = ||f||_∞ * ∫₀¹ t dt = ||f||_∞ * 1/2. Therefore, |T(f)| ≤ 1/2 ||f||_∞, so this shows that ||T|| ≤ 1/2.\n\nTo show that this is actually the norm, we need to find a function f with ||f||_∞ = 1 such that |T(f)| = 1/2. The idea is to take a function that is 1 whenever t is positive, but since t is always non-negative on [0,1], the maximum would be achieved by taking f(t) = 1 for all t. Then T(f) = ∫₀¹ t * 1 dt = 1/2. So indeed, if we take f(t) = 1 for all t, then ||f||_∞ = 1 and T(f) = 1/2. Therefore, the operator norm ||T|| is exactly 1/2.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me verify this again. The operator norm is the supremum of |T(f)| over all f with ||f||_∞ ≤ 1. So if we take f ≡ 1, which is certainly in C[0,1] and has norm 1, then T(f) = ∫₀¹ t dt = [t²/2]₀¹ = 1/2. So that gives us 1/2. But could there be another function f with ||f||_∞ ≤ 1 for which |T(f)| is larger?\n\nSuppose there exists some f with |f(t)| ≤ 1 for all t, and ∫₀¹ t f(t) dt > 1/2. Is that possible?\n\nTo maximize ∫₀¹ t f(t) dt, given that |f(t)| ≤ 1, we need to choose f(t) to be 1 whenever t is positive, right? Since t is non-negative on [0,1], the integrand t f(t) is maximized when f(t) = 1 for all t. Because t is non-negative, multiplying by f(t)=1 will give the maximum possible value. If we set f(t) = 1 wherever t is positive (which is everywhere on [0,1] except t=0), then we get the integral equal to 1/2. If we try to set f(t) = sign(t), but t is already non-negative, so sign(t) is 1 for t>0 and 0 at t=0, but in [0,1], t is non-negative, so the maximum would be achieved by f(t)=1. Therefore, the maximum value of T(f) is indeed 1/2, so the operator norm is 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we take a sequence of functions approaching the Dirac delta function at t=1. But wait, f has to be continuous. If we take a sequence of continuous functions that approximate the Dirac delta, like functions that are 1 at t=1, 0 on [0,1-ε], and linear in between. Then, the integral ∫₀¹ t f(t) dt would be approximately ∫_{1-ε}^1 t * 1 dt + the linear part. But as ε approaches 0, the integral approaches ∫_{1}^1 t dt = 0, which is not helpful. Wait, actually, no. Wait, if we take a spike near t=1, but since we are multiplying by t, which is approaching 1, the integral would be approximately (1-ε/2) * ε, which goes to 0 as ε→0. So that's worse than the constant function.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we take f(t) = sign(t - a) for some a. But f must be continuous. If we take a function that is 1 on [a,1] and -1 on [0,a), but adjusted to be continuous, like a linear function crossing zero at a. Wait, but then integrating t f(t) would involve integrating t times 1 on [a,1] and t times (-1) on [0,a). But the integral would be ∫₀¹ t f(t) dt = ∫₀^a (-t) dt + ∫_a^1 t dt = (-a²/2) + (1/2 - a²/2) = 1/2 - a². Hmm, this is maximized when a is as small as possible. Wait, if a approaches 0, then the integral approaches 1/2 - 0 = 1/2. If a approaches 1, then it approaches 1/2 - 1 = -1/2. So actually, if we take a function that is -1 on [0,a) and 1 on [a,1], connected linearly around a to make it continuous, then as a approaches 0, the integral approaches 1/2, but the function becomes discontinuous. However, even if we take a continuous approximation, as a approaches 0, the integral approaches 1/2. But the original function f(t)=1 already gives 1/2. So even with these functions, we can't get more than 1/2. Therefore, the maximum is indeed achieved by the constant function 1, so the operator norm is 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Hölder's inequality. Since we have T(f) = ∫₀¹ t f(t) dt. Hölder's inequality tells us that |∫₀¹ t f(t) dt| ≤ ||t||_1 ||f||_∞, but wait, Hölder's inequality is for conjugate exponents. Wait, if we consider the integral as the inner product in L^2, but maybe that's not helpful here. Wait, actually, Hölder's inequality states that |∫ f g| ≤ ||f||_p ||g||_q where 1/p + 1/q = 1. In this case, if we take p=∞ and q=1, then |∫ f g| ≤ ||f||_∞ ||g||_1. Here, g(t) = t, so ||g||_1 = ∫₀¹ |t| dt = 1/2. Therefore, |T(f)| ≤ ||f||_∞ * 1/2, which shows that ||T|| ≤ 1/2. And equality is achieved when f is constant 1, so indeed ||T|| = 1/2.\n\nTherefore, after going through different approaches—using the Riesz Representation Theorem, direct estimation, considering specific functions, and Hölder's inequality—it seems that the operator norm of T is indeed 1/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe norm of \\( T \\) is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}\\)."}

The problem mentions using the Cauchy residue theorem, which I remember involves finding the residues at the singular points inside the contour and then summing them up multiplied by 2πi. The singularities here are given as z = -3π/2, -π/2, π/2, and 3π/2. Let me make sure I understand how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall that tan(z) is sin(z)/cos(z), so its singularities occur where cos(z) is zero. The zeros of cos(z) are at z = (2k+1)π/2 for integers k. So, for the contour |z|=2π, which is a circle with radius 2π centered at the origin, I need to find all the singular points inside this circle.\n\nWait, the problem already lists the singularities as -3π/2, -π/2, π/2, and 3π/2. Let me check if these points are indeed inside the contour |z|=2π. The modulus of each of these points is |±3π/2| = 3π/2 ≈ 4.712 and |±π/2| ≈ 1.571. But the contour is radius 2π ≈ 6.283. So 3π/2 ≈ 4.712 is less than 2π, so yes, all four points are inside the contour. Okay, so these are the four singularities we need to consider.\n\nNext, I need to compute the residue at each of these points. For a function of the form f(z)/g(z), where f(z) is analytic and g(z) has a simple zero at z0, the residue is f(z0)/g’(z0). Since tan(z) = sin(z)/cos(z), here f(z) = sin(z) and g(z) = cos(z). The derivative of g(z) is -sin(z). Therefore, the residue at each singularity z0 should be sin(z0)/(-sin(z0)) = -1. Wait, that seems too simple. Let me verify.\n\nIf z0 is a simple pole of tan(z), then Res(tan(z), z0) = lim_{z→z0} (z - z0) tan(z). Alternatively, since tan(z) = sin(z)/cos(z), and cos(z0)=0, then the residue is sin(z0)/cos’(z0). But cos’(z) = -sin(z), so the residue is sin(z0)/(-sin(z0)) = -1. So indeed, the residue at each simple pole z0 = (2k+1)π/2 is -1. Therefore, each of the four singular points inside |z|=2π has residue -1.\n\nWait, but let me check with specific points. Let's take z = π/2. Then sin(π/2) = 1, cos(π/2) = 0, and cos’(π/2) = -sin(π/2) = -1. Therefore, residue is 1 / (-1) = -1. Similarly, at z = 3π/2, sin(3π/2) = -1, so residue is (-1)/(-(-1))? Wait, hold on. Let's see: If z0 = 3π/2, then sin(z0) = sin(3π/2) = -1, and cos’(z0) = -sin(z0) = -(-1) = 1. Wait, so then the residue would be sin(z0)/cos’(z0) = (-1)/1 = -1. Wait, that's not right. Wait, no. Wait, cos’(z0) is -sin(z0). So, cos’(3π/2) = -sin(3π/2) = -(-1) = 1. Then, the residue is sin(3π/2)/cos’(3π/2) = (-1)/1 = -1. So yes, even at z = 3π/2, the residue is -1. Similarly, for -π/2: sin(-π/2) = -1, cos’(-π/2) = -sin(-π/2) = -(-1) = 1, so residue is (-1)/1 = -1. Similarly, for -3π/2: sin(-3π/2) = 1, cos’(-3π/2) = -sin(-3π/2) = -1, so residue is 1 / (-1) = -1. So in all four cases, the residue is -1.\n\nTherefore, the sum of the residues is 4*(-1) = -4. Then, multiplying by 2πi gives the integral as 2πi*(-4) = -8πi. But wait, the problem says to express the integral as 2πi times the sum of the residues. So the answer should be 2πi*(sum of residues), which is 2πi*(-4) = -8πi. But let me check again if I didn't make a mistake here.\n\nWait, so each residue is -1, four residues, so sum is -4. Multiply by 2πi, so the integral is -8πi. But let me confirm this with another approach. Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that tan(z) has period π, so integrating over a larger contour, but maybe that's complicating. Alternatively, maybe compute the integral using series expansion or something else. But since all the residues are -1, the total is -4. So the integral is -8πi.\n\nBut let me think again. Wait, the function tan(z) is periodic with period π, and it has simple poles at all (2k+1)π/2. The contour |z|=2π will enclose all poles from k=-2 to k=1, since (2k+1)π/2 for k=-2: (2*(-2)+1)π/2 = (-3π)/2, k=-1: (-π)/2, k=0: π/2, k=1: 3π/2. So exactly four poles. So residues at each of them are -1, so sum is -4. Therefore, integral is -8πi.\n\nWait, but another way to compute the integral of tan(z) around a large circle. But maybe tan(z) doesn't decay at infinity? Wait, tan(z) is periodic and doesn't go to zero as |z| goes to infinity. So perhaps the integral over a large circle doesn't go to zero. But in this case, the radius is 2π, which is finite, so we just compute the residues inside. So perhaps the answer is indeed -8πi.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check with another method. For example, integrating tan(z) around the contour |z|=2π. But integrating tan(z) is the same as integrating sin(z)/cos(z). Maybe substitution: Let w = cos(z), then dw = -sin(z)dz. But then the integral becomes ∫ (-dw)/w around some contour. But I need to check how the contour transforms under w = cos(z). But since the original contour is |z|=2π, which is a circle of radius 2π. The function cos(z) maps this contour into some closed curve in the w-plane. But integrating -dw/w around a closed curve would give -2πi times the winding number around the origin. But I'm not sure if this is helpful here, because the image of the contour under cos(z) might wind around the origin multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better substitution. Wait, but maybe using the residue theorem is straightforward here, since all the residues are simple to calculate. Since each residue is -1, and there's four of them, so sum is -4, then integral is 2πi*(-4) = -8πi. So the final answer is -8πi.\n\nBut let me check once more. Suppose I take z = π/2, which is a simple pole. The residue is lim_{z→π/2} (z - π/2) tan(z). Let's compute that. Let’s set t = z - π/2, so as z approaches π/2, t approaches 0. Then tan(z) = tan(t + π/2) = -cot(t). So tan(z) = -cot(t) = -cos(t)/sin(t). So (z - π/2) tan(z) = t*(-cos(t)/sin(t)). As t→0, cos(t) ≈ 1, sin(t) ≈ t, so this becomes t*(-1/t) = -1. Therefore, the limit is -1. Similarly for the other poles. So yes, residues are all -1.\n\nTherefore, the integral is 2πi times sum of residues, which is 2πi*(-1 -1 -1 -1) = -8πi. So I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the contour integral is \\boxed{-8\\pi i}."}
{"instruction": "Evaluate the integral: $$\\int\\limits_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}x^4e^{-\\frac{1}{2}x^2}\\;\\mathrm{d}x$$\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{{}}.", "output": "Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral of x⁴ times e^(-½x²) from negative infinity to positive infinity. Hmm, that looks like a Gaussian integral, but with an x⁴ term. I remember that Gaussian integrals usually involve e^(-x²) or similar exponents, and their solutions often involve the gamma function or factorial terms when multiplied by polynomial terms like xⁿ. Let me think.\n\nFirst, the standard Gaussian integral is ∫_{-∞}^{∞} e^(-ax²) dx = √(π/a). But here, we have x⁴ multiplied by e^(-½x²). So maybe I can use some properties of the Gaussian integrals when multiplied by powers of x. I recall that for the integral ∫_{-∞}^{∞} x²ⁿ e^{-bx²} dx, there's a formula involving double factorials or gamma functions. Let me recall the exact formula.\n\nThe general formula for ∫_{-∞}^{∞} x²ⁿ e^{-bx²} dx is (2n-1)!! / (2bⁿ) * √(π/b). Wait, let me check that. Alternatively, using the gamma function, since Γ(n+½) relates to these integrals. Hmm, the gamma function Γ(n) = ∫₀^∞ x^{n-1} e^{-x} dx. But how does that connect here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using integration by parts. Let's see. Let me try that. Let u = x³ and dv = x e^{-½x²} dx. Wait, but integrating by parts might get complicated here, but let me try. Wait, if we set u = x³, then du = 3x² dx. Then dv = x e^{-½x²} dx. To find v, we need to integrate dv. Let me compute v = ∫ x e^{-½x²} dx. Let’s substitute t = -½x², so dt = -x dx. Then ∫ x e^{-½x²} dx = -∫ e^t dt = -e^t + C = -e^{-½x²} + C. So v = -e^{-½x²}. Then integration by parts gives uv|_{-∞}^{∞} - ∫ v du. The uv term is x³*(-e^{-½x²}) evaluated from -infty to infty. As x approaches ±infty, e^{-½x²} approaches zero, and x³ approaches ±infty, but the exponential decays faster, so the product should approach zero. Therefore, the uv term is zero. Then we have - ∫ v du = - ∫ (-e^{-½x²}) * 3x² dx = 3 ∫ x² e^{-½x²} dx. So the original integral ∫x⁴ e^{-½x²} dx = 3 ∫x² e^{-½x²} dx. Hmm, so now I need to compute ∫x² e^{-½x²} dx from -infty to infty. Let me call that integral I₂, and the original integral I₄ = 3I₂.\n\nNow compute I₂. Let's do integration by parts again. Let u = x, dv = x e^{-½x²} dx. Then du = dx, and v is the same as before, which is -e^{-½x²}. Then integration by parts gives uv|_{-infty}^{infty} - ∫ v du. Again, uv is x*(-e^{-½x²}) which tends to 0 at both limits. Then we have - ∫ (-e^{-½x²}) dx = ∫ e^{-½x²} dx. So I₂ = ∫x² e^{-½x²} dx = ∫ e^{-½x²} dx. But ∫_{-infty}^{infty} e^{-½x²} dx is a standard Gaussian integral. The standard integral ∫_{-infty}^{infty} e^{-a x²} dx = √(π/a). So here, a = ½, so the integral is √(π/(½)) = √(2π). Therefore, I₂ = √(2π). Then going back, I₄ = 3I₂ = 3 * √(2π). But wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, let me check. Wait, when I did integration by parts for I₂, I got I₂ = ∫ e^{-½x²} dx. But ∫_{-infty}^{infty} e^{-½x²} dx = √(2π). So yes, I₂ = √(2π). Then I₄ = 3 * √(2π). Therefore, the integral ∫x⁴ e^{-½x²} dx from -infty to infty is 3√(2π). But wait, is that the final answer? Hmm.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me verify with the formula I remember. For the Gaussian moments, the even moments are given by ∫_{-infty}^{infty} x^{2n} e^{-ax²} dx = (2n-1)!! * (π/a)^{½} / (2a^n). Wait, let me check that. Let me see. Maybe I should recall that for the standard normal distribution, where the integral is ∫x^{2n} e^{-x²/2} dx / √(2π) is (2n-1)!!. So the integral itself would be (2n-1)!! * √(2π). Wait, so if we have e^{-x²/2}, then ∫x^{2n} e^{-x²/2} dx from -infty to infty is (2n-1)!! * √(2π). So in this case, our integral is exactly that. Here, a = ½. Wait, but the standard formula is for e^{-ax²}, so let's adjust.\n\nWait, let's suppose that we have ∫_{-infty}^{infty} x^{2n} e^{-ax²} dx. Then, by substituting t = √(a) x, the integral becomes ∫_{-infty}^{infty} (t/√a)^{2n} e^{-t²} * (1/√a) dt) = (1/a^{n + ½}) ∫ t^{2n} e^{-t²} dt. Then ∫ t^{2n} e^{-t²} dt from -infty to infty is the same as 2 ∫0^infty t^{2n} e^{-t²} dt. Let me recall that ∫0^infty t^{2n} e^{-t²} dt = (2n-1)!! * √π / 2^{n+1} }? Wait, maybe better expressed in terms of the gamma function. Since Γ(n) = ∫0^infty t^{n-1} e^{-t} dt. Let me see. Let u = t², then t = √u, dt = (1/(2√u)) du. Then ∫0^infty t^{2n} e^{-t²} dt = ∫0^infty u^n e^{-u} (1/(2√u)) du = (1/2) ∫0^infty u^{n - ½} e^{-u} du = (1/2) Γ(n + ½). Therefore, ∫_{-infty}^{infty} t^{2n} e^{-t²} dt = Γ(n + ½). Then, going back, the original integral ∫x^{2n} e^{-ax²} dx = (1/a^{n + ½}) Γ(n + ½). So for our case, a = ½. So substituting, ∫x^{2n} e^{-½x²} dx = (1/(½)^{n + ½}) Γ(n + ½) = 2^{n + ½} Γ(n + ½). Then for n=2, since we have x⁴, which is x^{2*2}, so n=2. So the integral is 2^{2 + ½} Γ(2 + ½) = 2^{5/2} Γ(5/2). Now, Γ(5/2) is (3/2)(1/2)√π = (3/4)√π. Wait, Γ(1/2) is √π, Γ(3/2) = (1/2)Γ(1/2) = (1/2)√π, Γ(5/2) = (3/2)Γ(3/2) = (3/2)(1/2)√π = (3/4)√π. Therefore, 2^{5/2} * (3/4)√π = (32^(1/2))? Wait, 2^{5/2} is 2^2 * 2^{1/2} = 4 * √2. So 4√2 * (3/4)√π = 3√2 * √π = 3√(2π). Which matches the previous result. So that's good. So both methods give the same answer. So the integral is 3√(2π). Therefore, the answer should be 3 times the square root of 2π. Let me write that as 3√(2π). So that's the value of the integral.\n\nAlternatively, if I recall that for the standard normal distribution, which has the density (1/√(2π)) e^{-x²/2}, the even moments are E[X^{2n}] = (2n-1)!!. Therefore, the integral ∫x^{2n} e^{-x²/2} dx = (2n-1)!! * √(2π). So for n=2, (2*2 -1)!! = 3!! = 3*1 = 3. Therefore, the integral is 3 * √(2π). Yep, same result. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer is 3√(2π).\n\nBut let me just check once more with the integration by parts approach. First, ∫x⁴ e^{-½x²} dx = 3 ∫x² e^{-½x²} dx. Then ∫x² e^{-½x²} dx = √(2π). So 3 * √(2π). So that seems to check out. So I think that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute using substitution. Let me try substitution. Let me consider t = x²/2. But I'm not sure. Maybe not the easiest way. Alternatively, write x⁴ as x³ * x, but integration by parts worked. So yes, I think the answer is 3√(2π).\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the moment generating function. The integral ∫x⁴ e^{-½x²} dx is related to the fourth moment of a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. Wait, the standard normal distribution has density (1/√(2π)) e^{-x²/2}, so the fourth moment E[X⁴] would be 3. Therefore, the integral ∫x⁴ e^{-x²/2} dx = 3 * √(2π). So that's the same answer. Therefore, the integral is 3√(2π). So I think that's correct.\n\nTherefore, after going through multiple methods: integration by parts, gamma function, and moments of the normal distribution, all leading to the same result. Therefore, the value of the integral is 3 times the square root of 2π.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the integral is \\boxed{3\\sqrt{2\\pi}}."}
{"instruction": "Evaluate the limit: \\[ \\lim_{x\\to0}\\frac{1}{x}\\int_1^{1+x}\\frac{\\cos t}{t} \\, dt \\]\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{{}}.", "output": "Okay, so I need to find the limit as x approaches 0 of (1/x) times the integral from 1 to 1+x of (cos t)/t dt. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nFirst, I remember that when you have a limit involving an integral like this, especially where the variable is in both the upper limit of the integral and as a coefficient outside, it might be a good idea to use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Maybe I can apply L’Hospital’s Rule here? Wait, but before jumping to that, let me recall that the expression (1/x) times the integral from a to a+x of some function is related to the average value of the function over the interval [a, a+x]. As x approaches 0, this average value should approach the value of the function at a, right? So maybe this limit is just the function evaluated at t=1? But the function here is (cos t)/t, so would the limit be cos(1)/1? That is, cos(1). But wait, is that correct? Let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the definition of the derivative. Because the integral from 1 to 1+x of (cos t)/t dt is F(1+x) - F(1), where F is the antiderivative of (cos t)/t. Then, dividing by x and taking the limit as x approaches 0 would be the definition of the derivative of F at 1. So the limit is F’(1). But since F is the antiderivative of (cos t)/t, F’(1) would just be (cos 1)/1. So that would again give cos(1). Hmm, so both methods give the same answer. But let me check step by step more carefully to make sure I'm not missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe expand the integrand in a Taylor series around t=1. Since x is approaching 0, the upper limit 1+x is close to 1. So we can approximate cos t / t near t=1. Let's try that. Let’s set t = 1 + s, where s is small. Then, when t is near 1, s is near 0. Then, cos(1 + s) / (1 + s). Let me expand this as a Taylor series around s=0. \n\nFirst, cos(1 + s) can be written using the cosine addition formula: cos(1 + s) = cos(1)cos(s) - sin(1)sin(s). Then, expanding cos(s) and sin(s) to first order: cos(s) ≈ 1 - s^2/2 and sin(s) ≈ s - s^3/6. But since s is approaching 0, maybe even just up to linear terms. Wait, but since we are integrating from s=0 to s=x (since t goes from 1 to 1+x, then s goes from 0 to x), and then dividing by x. So perhaps expanding up to the first order would suffice.\n\nBut perhaps even better, the integrand cos t / t near t=1 can be approximated by its value at t=1 plus the derivative at t=1 times (t - 1), right? Using the first-order Taylor expansion. Let me do that.\n\nLet f(t) = cos t / t. Then, the first-order Taylor expansion around t=1 is f(1) + f’(1)(t - 1). Then, integrating that from 1 to 1+x would give f(1)*x + (f’(1)/2)x^2. Then, dividing by x gives f(1) + (f’(1)/2)x. Then taking the limit as x approaches 0 would just give f(1). So again, f(1) = cos(1)/1 = cos(1). So that seems consistent. But let's compute f’(t) just to be thorough. f(t) = cos t / t, so f’(t) = (-sin t * t - cos t)/t^2 by the quotient rule. So f’(1) = (-sin(1)*1 - cos(1))/1 = -sin(1) - cos(1). But since we only need up to first order, when integrating, the integral would be [f(1) + f’(1)(t - 1)] from 1 to 1+x. Wait, but actually, integrating f(1) from 1 to 1+x is f(1)*x. Integrating f’(1)(t - 1) from 1 to 1+x is f’(1) * integral of (t - 1) dt from 1 to 1+x. Let u = t - 1, then integral from u=0 to u=x of u du = (1/2)x^2. So the integral is f’(1)*(1/2)x^2. Then, dividing by x gives f(1) + (f’(1)/2)x. Then as x approaches 0, the second term vanishes, leaving f(1) = cos(1). So this seems to confirm the answer.\n\nAlternatively, using L’Hospital’s Rule. Since as x approaches 0, the integral from 1 to 1+x of (cos t)/t dt approaches 0, and the denominator x also approaches 0. So we have a 0/0 indeterminate form, which means L’Hospital’s Rule applies. So taking the derivative of the numerator and denominator with respect to x. The derivative of the numerator, by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, is the integrand evaluated at the upper limit times the derivative of the upper limit. Since the upper limit is 1+x, the derivative is (d/dx) [integral from 1 to 1+x of (cos t)/t dt] = (cos(1+x)/(1+x)) * 1. The derivative of the denominator x is 1. So applying L’Hospital’s Rule, the limit becomes [cos(1+x)/(1+x)] / 1 evaluated at x approaching 0. Therefore, cos(1+0)/(1+0) = cos(1)/1 = cos(1). So again, same result.\n\nTherefore, all methods point towards the limit being cos(1). So I think that's the answer. But let me just verify once more.\n\nWait, but what's the exact statement of L’Hospital’s Rule? It requires that the limit of f(x)/g(x) is of indeterminate form 0/0 or ±∞/±∞, and that the limit of f’(x)/g’(x) exists. In this case, as x approaches 0, the integral from 1 to 1+x of (cos t)/t dt does approach 0 because the interval of integration becomes length 0, and the integrand is continuous (since cos t / t is continuous around t=1, as t=1 is not 0). So yes, both numerator and denominator approach 0. The derivative of the numerator is cos(1+x)/(1+x), which is continuous at x=0, so the limit as x approaches 0 is cos(1)/1. Therefore, L’Hospital’s Rule gives the limit as cos(1). \n\nAlternatively, using the Mean Value Theorem for integrals. There exists a point c in [1, 1+x] such that the integral from 1 to 1+x of (cos t)/t dt = (cos c)/c * x. Then, (1/x)*integral becomes (cos c)/c. As x approaches 0, c approaches 1, so (cos c)/c approaches cos(1)/1. So again, same answer. \n\nTherefore, all methods lead to the same conclusion. So I think the answer is cos(1). Therefore, the limit is cos(1), so boxed answer is \\boxed{\\cos 1}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\cos 1}"}
{"instruction": "Calculate the integral \\( \\int_{\\mathbb{R}^3} e^{-2\\left \\| x \\right \\|}d^3x \\).\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{{}}.", "output": "Okay, so I need to calculate the integral of e^{-2||x||} over all of three-dimensional space. Hmm, let's see. First, the integral is ∫_{ℝ³} e^{-2||x||} d³x. Since this is a three-dimensional integral and the integrand depends only on the magnitude of x, which is the distance from the origin, it makes sense to use spherical coordinates. In spherical coordinates, the volume element d³x becomes r² sinθ dr dθ dφ. So, the integral should simplify by separating the radial part from the angular parts.\n\nLet me recall: in spherical coordinates, any spherically symmetric function (depending only on r) can be integrated by integrating over the radius and multiplying by the surface area of the unit sphere in 3D, which is 4π. So, the integral should become 4π times the integral from 0 to infinity of e^{-2r} r² dr. Wait, is that right? Let me check.\n\nYes, because the volume element in spherical coordinates is r² sinθ dr dθ dφ. So, when we integrate over θ and φ, since the integrand doesn't depend on θ or φ, those integrals just give the surface area. The integral over φ is from 0 to 2π, and the integral over θ is from 0 to π. So, ∫₀²π dφ ∫₀^π sinθ dθ = 2π * [ -cosθ ]₀^π = 2π * ( -cosπ + cos0 ) = 2π * ( -(-1) + 1 ) = 2π * 2 = 4π. So that's correct. Therefore, the original integral reduces to 4π ∫₀^∞ r² e^{-2r} dr.\n\nNow, I need to compute this radial integral: ∫₀^∞ r² e^{-2r} dr. This looks like a standard gamma integral. Remember that ∫₀^∞ r^n e^{-ar} dr = Γ(n+1)/a^{n+1}, where Γ is the gamma function. For positive integers n, Γ(n+1) = n! So, in this case, n=2, a=2. Therefore, the integral should be Γ(3)/2³ = 2!/8 = 2/8 = 1/4. Wait, hold on: Γ(n+1) = n! So, Γ(3) = 2! = 2. Therefore, ∫₀^∞ r² e^{-2r} dr = 2 / (2³) = 2 / 8 = 1/4. So that integral is 1/4. Therefore, multiplying by 4π gives 4π * 1/4 = π. So the final answer should be π. Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify step by step to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the radial integral by integration by parts. Let's try that. Let me set u = r², dv = e^{-2r} dr. Then, du = 2r dr, and v = -1/(2) e^{-2r}. So, integration by parts gives uv|₀^∞ - ∫₀^∞ v du. Let's evaluate uv at the limits. As r approaches infinity, e^{-2r} approaches 0, so the term at infinity is 0. At r=0, r² is 0, so uv at 0 is also 0. Therefore, the first term is 0, and the remaining integral is - ∫₀^∞ (-1/2) e^{-2r} * 2r dr. Simplify: the negatives cancel, and the 2 and 1/2 also simplify. So, we have ∫₀^∞ r e^{-2r} dr. Okay, so that reduces the integral from r² to r. Let's do integration by parts again. Let u = r, dv = e^{-2r} dr. Then du = dr, v = -1/(2) e^{-2r}. Then, uv|₀^∞ - ∫₀^∞ v du. Again, uv at infinity is 0, at 0 is 0, so the first term is 0. The remaining integral is - ∫₀^∞ (-1/2) e^{-2r} dr. Simplify: the negatives cancel, so (1/2) ∫₀^∞ e^{-2r} dr. Which is (1/2) * [ -1/(2) e^{-2r} ]₀^∞ = (1/2)( 0 - (-1/2) ) = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4. So that's the same result as before. So the integral ∫₀^∞ r² e^{-2r} dr is indeed 1/4.\n\nTherefore, multiplying by 4π gives 4π * 1/4 = π. So the integral over all space is π. That seems right. Let me just check with another method. For example, using the gamma function formula again. In three dimensions, the integral ∫_{ℝ³} e^{-a||x||} d³x. Then, converting to spherical coordinates, as we did, gives 4π ∫₀^∞ r² e^{-a r} dr. Then, this is 4π * Γ(3)/a³ = 4π * 2! /a³ = 8π /a³. Wait, but in our case, a=2, so 8π /8 = π. Yes, exactly. So that's another way to see it. So in general, ∫_{ℝ³} e^{-a||x||} d³x = 8π /a³. Then plugging a=2, we get 8π /8 = π. So this is a general formula, which gives the same result. Therefore, the answer is π.\n\nBut wait, let me check the formula again. If the integral in n dimensions for ∫_{ℝⁿ} e^{-a||x||} d^n x is (2π)^{n/2} / a^{n} } or something else? Wait, maybe not. Because when you have e^{-a||x||}, which is a exponential decay, not a Gaussian. For Gaussian integrals, ∫ e^{-a x²} dx = √(π/a), but this is different. Here it's exponential decay. So for 3D, using spherical coordinates, we have 4π ∫₀^∞ r² e^{-a r} dr. Which is 4π Γ(3)/a³ = 4π * 2 /a³ = 8π /a³, which for a=2 gives π, as above.\n\nAlternatively, if I remember the integral ∫₀^∞ r² e^{-a r} dr = 2 /a³. Wait, but Γ(3) = 2! = 2, so yes, Γ(3)/a³ = 2/a³. Then 4π times that is 8π /a³. So when a=2, it's 8π /8 = π. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the approach, the answer seems to be π. So I think that's the correct result. But just to make sure, let me think of another way.\n\nSuppose we use Cartesian coordinates. But integrating in 3D Cartesian coordinates would be a pain because ||x|| is the Euclidean norm, sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So the integral would be ∫_{-infty}^infty ∫_{-infty}^infty ∫_{-infty}^infty e^{-2 sqrt(x² + y² + z²)} dx dy dz. That seems really complicated to compute in Cartesian coordinates. So spherical coordinates is definitely the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using some Fourier transform or other tricks, but I don't think so. The spherical coordinates method is straightforward here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can relate it to the Laplace transform. Because ∫₀^∞ r² e^{-2r} dr is the Laplace transform of r² evaluated at s=2. The Laplace transform of t^n is Γ(n+1)/s^{n+1}, so yes, that's exactly what we did earlier.\n\nTherefore, I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. The integral reduces to 4π times the radial integral, which is 1/4, so total π. So I think the answer is π. Therefore, the value of the integral is π. So I can write that as \\boxed{\\pi}.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the integral is \\boxed{\\pi}."}

Hmm, let's see. First, I should probably figure out what angle 5π/12 is related to in terms of more familiar angles. Since π is 12π/12, then 5π/12 is less than π/2 (which is 6π/12). So it's in the first quadrant. \n\nMaybe I can express 5π/12 as a combination of other angles. Let's think: 5π/12 is equal to π/3 + π/4? Let me check that. π/3 is 4π/12 and π/4 is 3π/12. Adding them together gives 7π/12. Hmm, that's too much. Wait, maybe π/3 - π/4? That would be 4π/12 - 3π/12 = π/12. No, that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe 5π/12 is π/2 - π/12? Let's see, π/2 is 6π/12, so 6π/12 - π/12 = 5π/12. Yes, that works. So 5π/12 is π/2 - π/12. Therefore, cot(5π/12) is cot(π/2 - π/12). But cot(π/2 - x) is tan(x). So cot(5π/12) = tan(π/12). Wait, but the problem says to use the given identities. Maybe I should use the second identity: cot(θ - φ) = (cotθ cotφ + 1)/(cotφ - cotθ). Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, using the first identity: cot(2x) = 1/2 (cotx - tanx). If I can express 5π/12 as 2x, then x would be 5π/24, which is not a standard angle. Maybe that's not helpful. Let me think again. If 5π/12 is equal to π/3 + π/4? Wait, π/3 + π/4 is 7π/12, which is more than 5π/12. So that's not right. Wait, 5π/12 can be expressed as π/4 + π/6? Let's check: π/4 is 3π/12, π/6 is 2π/12, so together that's 5π/12. Yes! So 5π/12 is π/4 + π/6. So maybe I can use the cotangent addition formula. Wait, the given identity is for cot(θ - φ). But the problem mentions using those two identities. Hmm. Maybe I need to use the first identity, cot(2x) = 1/2 (cotx - tanx), and express 5π/12 in terms of a double angle?\n\nAlternatively, let me recall that cot(θ) = 1/tan(θ), so maybe if I can find tan(5π/12), then take its reciprocal. But again, the problem specifies to use the given identities. Let's see. Let's try the first identity. Let me set 2x = 5π/12. Then x = 5π/24. But that's not a standard angle, so maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps use the second identity. If I can write 5π/12 as the difference of two angles where I know the cotangent. For example, maybe π/3 - π/4? Let's compute that. π/3 is 4π/12, π/4 is 3π/12, so π/3 - π/4 = π/12. Not 5π/12. Wait, how about 3π/4 - π/3? That's 9π/12 - 4π/12 = 5π/12. Ah! So 5π/12 can be expressed as 3π/4 - π/3. Therefore, cot(5π/12) = cot(3π/4 - π/3). Then using the second identity: cot(θ - φ) = (cotθ cotφ + 1)/(cotφ - cotθ). Let's set θ = 3π/4 and φ = π/3. Then cot(3π/4 - π/3) = [cot(3π/4)cot(π/3) + 1]/[cot(π/3) - cot(3π/4)].\n\nLet me compute each term. First, cot(3π/4): 3π/4 is 135 degrees, which is in the second quadrant. Cotangent is cosine over sine. At 3π/4, cos(3π/4) = -√2/2, sin(3π/4) = √2/2. Therefore, cot(3π/4) = (-√2/2)/(√2/2) = -1. Next, cot(π/3): π/3 is 60 degrees. cot(60 degrees) is 1/tan(60 degrees) = 1/√3. So cot(π/3) = 1/√3. So substituting into the formula: [(-1)(1/√3) + 1]/[1/√3 - (-1)] = [(-1/√3 + 1)]/[1/√3 + 1].\n\nLet me simplify the numerator and denominator. Numerator: 1 - 1/√3. Denominator: 1 + 1/√3. So we have (1 - 1/√3)/(1 + 1/√3). To simplify this, multiply numerator and denominator by √3 to rationalize. That gives [√3 - 1]/[√3 + 1]. Now, we can rationalize the denominator again by multiplying numerator and denominator by (√3 - 1):\n\nNumerator: (√3 - 1)(√3 - 1) = (√3)^2 - 2√3 + 1 = 3 - 2√3 + 1 = 4 - 2√3\n\nDenominator: (√3 + 1)(√3 - 1) = (√3)^2 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2\n\nTherefore, [√3 - 1]/[√3 + 1] = (4 - 2√3)/2 = 2 - √3. So that means cot(5π/12) = 2 - √3. Wait, but wait. Let me check this. Because when I substituted into the formula, the formula was [cotθ cotφ + 1]/[cotφ - cotθ]. θ was 3π/4, φ was π/3.\n\nSo [cot(3π/4)cot(π/3) + 1]/[cot(π/3) - cot(3π/4)] = [(-1)(1/√3) + 1]/[1/√3 - (-1)] = [(-1/√3 + 1)]/[1/√3 + 1]. Then we multiplied numerator and denominator by √3, getting [√3 - 1]/[√3 + 1], then multiplied by [√3 - 1]/[√3 - 1], which gives (4 - 2√3)/2 = 2 - √3. So that's the answer. But let me verify this with another method to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, using the first identity given: cot(2x) = 1/2(cotx - tanx). Let's see if I can use this identity. If I set 2x = 5π/12, then x = 5π/24. Not helpful. Maybe another approach. Alternatively, perhaps express 5π/12 as 2*(5π/24), but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe relate 5π/12 to other angles. Wait, 5π/12 is π/2 - π/12, so cot(5π/12) = tan(π/12). Then, if I can compute tan(π/12) using some identity. For example, tan(π/12) = tan(π/3 - π/4). Using the tangent subtraction formula: tan(A - B) = (tanA - tanB)/(1 + tanA tanB). So tan(π/3 - π/4) = (tan(π/3) - tan(π/4))/(1 + tan(π/3)tan(π/4)). Compute that: (√3 - 1)/(1 + √3*1) = (√3 - 1)/(1 + √3). Multiply numerator and denominator by (√3 - 1): [(√3 - 1)^2]/[(1 + √3)(√3 - 1)] = (3 - 2√3 + 1)/(3 - 1) = (4 - 2√3)/2 = 2 - √3. So that's the same result as before. Therefore, tan(π/12) = 2 - √3, so cot(5π/12) = 2 - √3. So both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring.\n\nBut since the problem specifies to use the given identities, I think the second method using the cotangent subtraction formula is the one they want, even though the first method is also valid. So the answer is 2 - √3. Let me check with a calculator to make sure. Let's compute cot(5π/12). 5π/12 is 75 degrees. Cotangent of 75 degrees is 1/tan(75 degrees). Tan(75 degrees) is 2 + √3, so cot(75 degrees) is 1/(2 + √3). Rationalizing the denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by (2 - √3): (2 - √3)/[(2 + √3)(2 - √3)] = (2 - √3)/(4 - 3) = (2 - √3)/1 = 2 - √3. Yes, that's correct. So the value is 2 - √3. Therefore, using the identity for cot(θ - φ), we arrived at the correct answer. So the final answer is 2 - √3.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of \\(\\cot\\left(\\frac{5\\pi}{12}\\right)\\) is \\(\\boxed{2 - \\sqrt{3}}\\)."}

Hmm, radius of convergence... Right, that usually involves using the root test or the ratio test. Since the terms have x raised to the n² power, it might be a bit different from the standard power series where it's x^n. But I think the root test could still work here. Let me recall, the radius of convergence R is given by 1 over the limit superior as n approaches infinity of |a_n|^(1/n), where a_n is the coefficient of x^n. But in this case, the exponent of x is n², so maybe the formula adjusts? Wait, maybe I need to treat it as a power series in x, where the exponents are n² instead of n. So the general form is Σ a_k x^k, but here the exponents are only the squares, so k = n². So the coefficients a_k are zero except when k is a perfect square. Then, for such series, the radius of convergence can still be found using the root test, but maybe adjusted for the exponents.\n\nAlternatively, maybe substitution. Let me set y = x, then perhaps express it in terms of y^(n²). Hmm, but I don't know. Let me think again. The standard formula for radius of convergence is R = 1 / lim sup |a_n|^(1/n). But here, the exponents of x are n², not n. So, if I let m = n², then the series can be written as Σ a_m x^m, where a_m = (sqrt(m)² * sin(2/sqrt(m)²))^{sqrt(m)² + 2} when m is a perfect square, and zero otherwise. But this seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe using the formula for lacunary series? Wait, lacunary series are those with gaps in the exponents, like only x^{n²}. They can have different behavior, but the radius of convergence can still be determined by the root test applied to the coefficients. Wait, let's check.\n\nSuppose the series is Σ_{n=1}^\\infty c_n x^{k_n}, where k_n are positive integers increasing to infinity. Then the radius of convergence R is given by 1 / lim sup |c_n|^{1/k_n}. Is that correct? Let me verify. If we let x be such that |x| < R, then |c_n x^{k_n}|^{1/k_n} = |c_n|^{1/k_n} |x|. So if lim sup |c_n|^{1/k_n} |x| < 1, then the series converges absolutely. So yes, R = 1 / lim sup |c_n|^{1/k_n}. So in our case, the exponents are k_n = n², and the coefficients are c_n = (n² sin(2/n²))^{n² + 2}. Therefore, R = 1 / lim sup |c_n|^{1/n²}. So I need to compute lim sup_{n→∞} |c_n|^{1/n²} = lim sup_{n→∞} [(n² sin(2/n²))^{n² + 2}]^{1/n²} = lim sup (n² sin(2/n²))^{(n² + 2)/n²} = lim sup (n² sin(2/n²))^{1 + 2/n²}.\n\nNow, since 2/n² approaches 0 as n approaches infinity, the exponent 1 + 2/n² approaches 1. So maybe we can split the limit into the product of two parts: (n² sin(2/n²))^{1} * (n² sin(2/n²))^{2/n²}. Then take the limit as n approaches infinity.\n\nFirst, compute the limit of n² sin(2/n²) as n approaches infinity. Let's make a substitution: let t = 1/n², so as n → ∞, t → 0. Then the expression becomes (1/t) sin(2t). As t approaches 0, sin(2t) ~ 2t - (2t)^3/6 + ... So sin(2t) ≈ 2t for small t. Therefore, (1/t) * sin(2t) ≈ (1/t)(2t) = 2. So the limit of n² sin(2/n²) as n→∞ is 2.\n\nSo the first part, (n² sin(2/n²))^1, approaches 2. The second part is (n² sin(2/n²))^{2/n²}. Let's compute the limit of this as n→∞. Let me take the natural logarithm to handle the exponent: ln[(n² sin(2/n²))^{2/n²}] = (2/n²) * ln(n² sin(2/n²)). So we need to compute the limit as n→∞ of (2/n²) * ln(n² sin(2/n²)).\n\nAgain, we can use the substitution t = 1/n², so t → 0 as n→∞. Then n² = 1/t, and sin(2/n²) = sin(2t). So ln(n² sin(2/n²)) = ln( (1/t) sin(2t) ) = ln(1/t) + ln(sin(2t)) = -ln t + ln(sin(2t)). As t→0, sin(2t) ~ 2t, so ln(sin(2t)) ~ ln(2t) = ln 2 + ln t. Therefore, ln(n² sin(2/n²)) ~ -ln t + ln 2 + ln t = ln 2. Therefore, the expression becomes approximately (2/n²)*ln 2. As n→∞, 2/n² → 0, so the entire limit is 0. Therefore, the second part (n² sin(2/n²))^{2/n²} approaches e^0 = 1.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together: lim sup (n² sin(2/n²))^{1 + 2/n²} = lim (2 * 1) = 2. Therefore, the lim sup is 2, so the radius of convergence R = 1/2.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check this. Because when taking the lim sup, but in our case, since the limit exists, the lim sup is just the limit. So yes, since the limit of |c_n|^{1/n²} is 2, then R = 1/2. But wait, radius of convergence is 1 over that limit? Wait, no. Wait, R is 1 divided by the lim sup of |c_n|^{1/k_n}, where k_n is the exponent of x. In our case, k_n = n². So R = 1 / lim sup |c_n|^{1/n²}. But we computed lim sup |c_n|^{1/n²} = 2. Therefore, R = 1/2. Hmm. So the radius of convergence is 1/2. Let me check if this makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in splitting the limit. Let me re-examine. The coefficient c_n is (n² sin(2/n²))^{n² + 2}. Then |c_n|^{1/n²} = (n² sin(2/n²))^{(n² + 2)/n²} = (n² sin(2/n²))^{1 + 2/n²}. So that's correct. Then, as n becomes large, n² sin(2/n²) approaches 2, as we saw. So (n² sin(2/n²))^{1 + 2/n²} ≈ 2^{1 + 0} = 2. So the limit is indeed 2, so lim sup is 2, hence R = 1/2. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can test for convergence at x = 1/2 and x = -1/2 to check the radius. Let's see. If x = 1/2, then the term becomes (n² sin(2/n²))^{n² + 2} * (1/2)^{n²} = [n² sin(2/n²) * (1/2)]^{n²} * (n² sin(2/n²))^2. Let's analyze the dominant part: [n² sin(2/n²) * (1/2)]^{n²}. As n→infty, n² sin(2/n²) approaches 2, so 2*(1/2) = 1. So the base approaches 1, but raised to the n² power. So the term becomes approximately 1^{n²} = 1, multiplied by (n² sin(2/n²))^2 ~ (2)^2 = 4. So the terms approach 4, which doesn't go to zero. Therefore, at x = 1/2, the series diverges because the terms don't approach zero. Similarly at x = -1/2, the terms would have absolute value approaching 4, so also diverges. Therefore, the radius of convergence is indeed 1/2, since inside |x| < 1/2 it converges, and at |x| = 1/2 it diverges.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be R = 1/2.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe radius of convergence is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}."}

From what I remember, the degree of such a map is essentially how many times the map wraps the domain circle around the target circle. For example, the identity map wraps it once, so its degree is 1, and a map like \\( z \\mapsto z^2 \\) would wrap it twice, so degree 2, and similarly for negative integers, it would wrap in the opposite direction but the absolute value gives the number of times. So maybe the degree here is just \\( k \\)? But I need to verify this more carefully.\n\nFirst, let me recall the definition of the degree. There are a few ways to define it. One common definition for maps \\( S^1 \\to S^1 \\) is the number of times the map wraps around the circle, considering orientation. Another way is using the induced homomorphism on the fundamental group.

Since \\( H_1(S^1) \\) is also \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), this aligns with the fundamental group approach.\n\nAnother approach is through the lifting of the map to the universal cover.

If we lift the map \\( f_k \\) to a map \\( \\tilde{f}_k: \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R} \\), then the degree is given by \\( \\tilde{f}_k(t + 1) - \\tilde{f}_k(t) \\). For the map \\( z^k \\), the lift should satisfy \\( p(\\tilde{f}_k(t)) = f_k(p(t)) = (e^{2\\pi i t})^k = e^{2\\pi i k t} = p(k t) \\). So the lift is \\( \\tilde{f}_k(t) = k t + c \\), where \\( c \\) is a constant. Since lifts are unique up to additive constants, the difference \\( \\tilde{f}_k(t + 1) - \\tilde{f}_k(t) = k(t + 1) + c - (k t + c) = k \\). Therefore, the degree is \\( k \\). So that gives another way to see it's \\( k \\).\n\nAlternatively, maybe using differentials. If we consider the map \\( f_k \\), its derivative at a point \\( z \\) is a linear map between tangent spaces. For \\( f_k(z) = z^k \\), the derivative is \\( f_k'(z) = k z^{k - 1} \\). Since the tangent space to \\( S^1 \\) at any point is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{R} \\), the derivative map multiplies the tangent vector by \\( k z^{k - 1} \\). But \\( z \\) is a point on the unit circle, so \\( |z| = 1 \\), and thus \\( |k z^{k - 1}| = |k| \\). Wait, but the derivative in terms of direction? Since multiplication by \\( z^{k - 1} \\) is a rotation, which doesn't affect the scaling factor. So the derivative is scaling by \\( k \\). Therefore, the degree should be \\( k \\), because the differential contributes a factor of \\( k \\), which counts the local degree, and since the map is a covering map (if \\( k \\neq 0 \\)), each point has \\( |k| \\) preimages, and the sign is determined by the orientation. Since the derivative is scaling by \\( k \\), which is positive if \\( k > 0 \\) and negative if \\( k < 0 \\), hence the degree is \\( k \\).\n\nAlternatively, I can think about the integral definition. For a smooth map \\( f: S^1 \\to S^1 \\), the degree can be computed as \\( \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{S^1} \\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} dz \\). Let's try that. Let me parameterize \\( S^1 \\) by \\( z = e^{2\\pi i t} \\), \\( t \\in [0, 1] \\). Then \\( f_k(z) = z^k = e^{2\\pi i k t} \\). Then \\( f'(z) dz = \\frac{d}{dt} e^{2\\pi i k t} dt = 2\\pi i k e^{2\\pi i k t} dt \\), so \\( \\frac{f'(z)}{f(z)} dz = \\frac{2\\pi i k e^{2\\pi i k t}}{e^{2\\pi i k t}} dt = 2\\pi i k dt \\). Therefore, the integral is \\( \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\times 2\\pi i k = k \\). So that gives another verification that the degree is \\( k \\).\n\nAlternatively, using homotopy theory. The degree is a homotopy invariant, and since \\( z^k \\) and \\( z^{k'} \\) are homotopic if and only if \\( k = k' \\), so each integer \\( k \\) corresponds to a distinct homotopy class, and the degree is precisely \\( k \\).\n\nAlternatively, thinking about preimages. For a regular value \\( w \\in S^1 \\), the degree is the sum of the signs of the Jacobian at each preimage. For \\( f_k(z) = z^k \\), the preimages of a point \\( w \\) are the \\( k \\)-th roots of \\( w \\). Assuming \\( w \\) is not 1, we can take \\( w = e^{2\\pi i \\theta} \\), then the solutions to \\( z^k = w \\) are \\( z = e^{2\\pi i (\\theta + n)/k} \\) for \\( n = 0, 1, ..., k-1 \\). Each of these preimages has a local degree of +1 if the map is orientation-preserving and -1 if orientation-reversing. Since the derivative at each point is \\( k z^{k - 1} \\), but since \\( z \\) is on the unit circle, \\( z^{k - 1} \\) has absolute value 1, so the derivative is multiplication by \\( k \\), which is a scaling by \\( |k| \\) and preserves orientation if \\( k > 0 \\) and reverses if \\( k < 0 \\). Therefore, each preimage contributes \\( \\text{sign}(k) \\), and there are \\( |k| \\) preimages, so the degree is \\( |k| \\times \\text{sign}(k) = k \\). Hence, again, the degree is \\( k \\).\n\nWait, but hold on. If \\( k \\) is negative, then the derivative is multiplication by a negative number, which would reverse orientation, so each local degree is -1, but there are \\( |k| \\) preimages. So the total degree would be \\( |k| \\times (-1) = -|k| = k \\). So that still gives \\( k \\). So that seems correct.\n\nLet me test with specific examples. Take \\( k = 1 \\). Then \\( f_1(z) = z \\), which is the identity map, so degree 1. Correct. For \\( k = 2 \\), \\( f_2(z) = z^2 \\), which wraps the circle around itself twice, so degree 2. For \\( k = -1 \\), \\( f_{-1}(z) = z^{-1} = \\overline{z} \\), which is reflection, which should have degree -1. That makes sense. Similarly, \\( k = 0 \\), but \\( f_0(z) = z^0 = 1 \\), which is a constant map. The degree of a constant map should be 0, since it doesn't wrap around the circle at all. So for \\( k = 0 \\), the degree is 0. Wait, but in the formula \\( k \\), that would hold. So all cases are covered.\n\nWait, but hold on. When \\( k = 0 \\), the map is constant, so the induced map on the fundamental group is trivial, which corresponds to multiplication by 0 on \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), so degree 0. Similarly, in the integral approach, \\( f_0(z) = 1 \\), so \\( f'(z) = 0 \\), so the integral would be 0. So yes, 0 is included.\n\nSo all these methods point to the degree being \\( k \\). Therefore, I can conclude that \\( d(f_k) = k \\).\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe degree of the map \\( f_k \\) is \\boxed{k}."}

Hmm, let me think. I remember that when integrating with respect to a function that's a step function, like the floor function [x], which is also called the greatest integer function, the integral becomes a sum. Is that right?\n\nLet me recall. If we have an integral of the form ∫_{a}^{b} f(x) dg(x), and if g(x) is a step function with jumps at certain points, then the integral is the sum of f evaluated at those jump points multiplied by the size of the jumps. So in this case, [x] increases by 1 at each integer. So between 0 and 3, the integer part [x] has jumps at x=1, x=2, and x=3. Wait, but the upper limit is 3, so does x=3 count? Since the integral is from 0 to 3, inclusive. Let me check that.\n\nIn the Riemann-Stieltjes integral, if the integrator function g(x) has a jump at the upper limit, then that point is included. So here, [x] jumps at each integer. So between 0 and 3, the jumps occur at x=1, x=2, and x=3. Therefore, the integral should be the sum of f(x) at x=1, x=2, and x=3 multiplied by the jump size, which is 1 each. Wait, but is the jump at x=3 included? Because the integral goes up to 3. So maybe yes, if it's closed on the upper end. But I need to confirm how the integral is defined when there's a jump at the endpoint.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the integral from 0 to 3 would include the jumps at 1, 2, but not at 3, if 3 is the upper limit. Hmm. Let me check an example. Suppose we have the integrator function [x], then the integral from 0 to n, where n is an integer, would include the jumps at 1, 2, ..., n. Wait, but if we have the integral up to but not including n, then it wouldn't. But since it's a closed interval [0, 3], the integral includes the jump at 3. So maybe at x=3, the jump is included.\n\nBut wait, in the Riemann-Stieltjes integral, when you have a jump at the endpoint, whether it's included depends on the definition. But generally, for the integral over [a, b], any jump at b is included. So I think the integral ∫_{0}^{3} f(x) d[x] would include the jump at 3. Therefore, the jumps are at 1, 2, 3. Each jump is of size 1. So the integral would be f(1) + f(2) + f(3). Wait, but wait, the integral is from 0 to 3. So does the jump at x=0 contribute?\n\nAt x=0, [x] is 0, and from the right side, as x approaches 0 from above, [x] is still 0. So there's no jump at x=0 because the function is continuous there. The first jump is at x=1. So yes, the jumps are at 1, 2, 3. Therefore, the integral is f(1) + f(2) + f(3). Let's compute f at these points. f(x) = x² + 1. So f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2, f(2) = 4 + 1 = 5, f(3) = 9 + 1 = 10. Therefore, the sum would be 2 + 5 + 10 = 17. So the integral is 17. Wait, is that right?\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Let's recall the formula for the Riemann-Stieltjes integral with respect to a step function. If g(x) is a step function with jumps of size c_k at points x_k, then ∫_{a}^{b} f(x) dg(x) = ∑_{k} f(x_k) c_k where the sum is over all jumps x_k in [a, b]. So in our case, the step function [x] has jumps at each integer x=1, 2, 3 within [0, 3]. Each jump is of size 1. Therefore, the integral is f(1)*1 + f(2)*1 + f(3)*1 = 2 + 5 + 10 = 17. That seems correct.\n\nBut I want to make sure that x=3 is included. Since the integral is from 0 to 3, closed interval. So in the definition, if the integrator has a jump at the upper endpoint, it is included. So yes, x=3 is included. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we model [x] as a sum of Heaviside step functions. For example, [x] = ∑_{n=0}^{∞} H(x - n), where H is the Heaviside function (0 for x < 0, 1 for x ≥ 0). Then the differential d[x] would be a sum of Dirac delta functions at each integer n, scaled by 1. Therefore, the integral ∫_{0}^{3} f(x) d[x] would be ∑_{n=1}^{3} f(n). But since the integral is up to 3, inclusive, then the delta function at 3 is included. Therefore, again, the sum is f(1) + f(2) + f(3) = 17.\n\nBut another way to check this is to consider the integral over [0, 3). If the integral were from 0 to 3, not including 3, then the jump at 3 wouldn't be included. So the answer would be f(1) + f(2) = 7. But in our case, the integral is from 0 to 3, including 3, so 17.\n\nAlternatively, if I write the integral as the limit as ε approaches 0 from the left of ∫_{0}^{3 - ε} f(x) d[x] plus the contribution at x=3. But in the Riemann-Stieltjes integral, the integral over [a, b] includes the jump at b if the integrator has a jump there. Therefore, even if you approach from the left, the integral includes the jump at the endpoint. Therefore, 17 is correct.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the definition of Riemann-Stieltjes. For a partition of [0, 3], with points 0 = x_0 < x_1 < ... < x_n = 3, and choosing tags in each subinterval. The Riemann-Stieltjes sum is ∑_{i=1}^{n} f(t_i)([x_i] - [x_{i-1}]). Since [x] is constant except at integers, the difference [x_i] - [x_{i-1}] is 0 unless there's an integer between x_{i-1} and x_i. So as the partition becomes finer, the only contributions to the sum come from subintervals containing the jump points 1, 2, 3. For each jump point, the difference [x_i] - [x_{i-1}] is 1, and as the partition is refined, the tag t_i must approach the jump point. Therefore, in the limit, the sum becomes f(1) + f(2) + f(3). Hence, the integral is 17.\n\nTherefore, I think 17 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{17}"}

Provide your answer as an integer.\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{{}}.", "output": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the dimension of the vector space ℂ[x,y]/I over ℂ, where the ideal I is generated by the polynomials y² - x² and y² + x². Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with quotient rings like this, the dimension can sometimes be found by looking at the number of standard monomials after applying Gröbner basis theory. But I need to recall how that works exactly.\n\nFirst, let me write down the generators of the ideal I: they are y² - x² and y² + x². Maybe I can try to simplify these generators first. If I add the two polynomials together, (y² - x²) + (y² + x²) = 2y². So 2y² is in the ideal I. Similarly, if I subtract them: (y² + x²) - (y² - x²) = 2x². So 2x² is also in I. Since we're working over ℂ, the field has characteristic zero, so 2 is invertible. Therefore, multiplying by 1/2, we get that y² and x² are both in I. That simplifies things because now I can say that I contains x² and y². \n\nWait, but the original generators are y² - x² and y² + x². If I have x² and y² in I, then y² - x² is just the difference of two elements of I, which is also in I. So actually, the ideal generated by y² - x² and y² + x² is the same as the ideal generated by x² and y². Let me check that.\n\nIf I = ⟨y² - x², y² + x²⟩, then since x² = ( (y² + x²) - (y² - x²) ) / 2 and y² = ( (y² + x²) + (y² - x²) ) / 2, then indeed x² and y² are in I. Conversely, since x² and y² are in I, then y² - x² and y² + x² are also in the ideal generated by x² and y². Therefore, I is equal to ⟨x², y²⟩. That simplifies the problem. So now I need to find the dimension of ℂ[x,y]/⟨x², y²⟩.\n\nI remember that for monomial ideals, the quotient ring's vector space dimension is equal to the number of standard monomials not in the ideal. Since ⟨x², y²⟩ is a monomial ideal, the standard monomials would be all monomials that are not divisible by x² or y². So in other words, the monomials of the form x^a y^b where a < 2 and b < 2. That would give us the possible exponents a = 0, 1 and b = 0, 1. So the standard monomials are 1, x, y, xy. Therefore, there are 4 standard monomials, so the dimension should be 4.\n\nWait, let me verify that. If we mod out by x² and y², then in the quotient ring, any higher power of x or y would be zero. So the only monomials that survive are indeed 1, x, y, and xy. So the vector space is spanned by these four elements, and they are linearly independent over ℂ. So the dimension is 4. Therefore, the answer should be 4.\n\nBut just to make sure I didn't skip any steps, let me think again. The original generators were y² - x² and y² + x², but we saw that these generate the same ideal as x² and y². Then, the quotient ring ℂ[x,y]/I is isomorphic to ℂ[x,y]/⟨x², y²⟩. The standard monomials here are indeed 1, x, y, xy. Therefore, the dimension is 4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the algebraic method of successive quotients. For example, first quotient out by x². Then ℂ[x,y]/⟨x²⟩ has a basis of monomials where x has exponent 0 or 1, and y can be any exponent. But then, we also need to quotient out by y². So in the second step, we set y² = 0. Therefore, in the quotient ℂ[x,y]/⟨x², y²⟩, the monomials can have x exponent 0 or 1 and y exponent 0 or 1. Hence, 2*2 = 4 dimensions. That confirms the earlier result.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the Chinese Remainder Theorem? Wait, but I don't see how that would apply here. The ideal ⟨x², y²⟩ is not a radical ideal, so the Chinese Remainder Theorem might not be directly applicable. Hmm, perhaps another approach.\n\nAlternatively, think about the variety defined by the ideal I. If I is generated by y² - x² and y² + x², then the solutions to both equations would be the common zeros. Let's see, solving y² = x² and y² = -x². So setting them equal: x² = -x², which implies 2x² = 0, hence x = 0. Then substituting back into y² = x² gives y² = 0, so y = 0. Therefore, the only common solution is (0, 0). So the ideal I defines the origin in ℂ². Then, the quotient ring ℂ[x,y]/I should be the local ring at the origin, but perhaps with higher multiplicity. But in algebraic geometry, the dimension of the quotient ring as a vector space is the multiplicity. For the origin, if the ideal is ⟨x, y⟩, then the quotient has dimension 1. But here, the ideal is ⟨x², y²⟩, which is a different ideal. So maybe the multiplicity is higher. Wait, in general, for an ideal defining a zero-dimensional variety, the dimension of the quotient ring is the sum of the multiplicities at each point. Since here, there is only the origin, the dimension is equal to the multiplicity at that point. For the ideal ⟨x², y²⟩, the multiplicity is 4, which matches our previous result.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the Hilbert function. For the ideal ⟨x², y²⟩, the Hilbert series is (1 - t^2)(1 - t^2)/(1 - t)^2) = (1 - 2t^2 + t^4)/(1 - t)^2. But perhaps expanding it, the Hilbert function in degree d is the number of monomials not divisible by x² or y². But since x² and y² are in the ideal, all monomials in the quotient are linear combinations of 1, x, y, xy. Thus, the Hilbert function is 4 in degree 0 and 1, and 0 for higher degrees. Therefore, the Hilbert polynomial is constant 4, so the dimension of the quotient ring is 4.\n\nTherefore, all these different approaches lead me to the same conclusion. The dimension of ℂ[x,y]/I is 4. So the answer is 4.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{4}"}
{"instruction": "Is the unit circle the only infinite compact subgroup of the multiplicative group of non-zero complex numbers? Specifically, if $G$ is an infinite subgroup of $(\\mathbb{C} \\setminus \\{0\\}, \\cdot)$ that is compact as a subset of $\\mathbb{C}$, is it true that $G = S^1$?\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{{}}.", "output": "Alright, so I need to figure out if the unit circle, S¹, is the only infinite compact subgroup of the multiplicative group of non-zero complex numbers, ℂ\\{0}. The question is asking if any infinite compact subgroup G of (ℂ\\{0}, ·) must necessarily be equal to S¹. Hmm. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts.\n\nFirst, the multiplicative group of complex numbers, ℂ\\{0}, is a Lie group under multiplication. The unit circle, S¹, is a compact subgroup of this group. In fact, S¹ is a maximal compact subgroup because any compact subgroup of ℂ\\{0} must be contained within S¹. Wait, is that true? Let me think. If a subgroup G is compact in ℂ\\{0}, then it must be closed and bounded, by the Heine-Borel theorem. Since ℂ is a metric space, compactness is equivalent to being closed and bounded. So if G is a compact subgroup, it must be closed and bounded in ℂ. Bounded implies that all elements of G have absolute value (modulus) bounded by some constant. But since G is a group under multiplication, if it contains an element z with |z| ≠ 1, then either |z| > 1 or |z| < 1. If |z| > 1, then powers of z (like zⁿ for n ∈ ℕ) would have |zⁿ| = |z|ⁿ, which tends to infinity as n increases. Similarly, if |z| < 1, then z⁻¹ would have |z⁻¹| = 1/|z| > 1, and powers of z⁻¹ would also go to infinity. But G is supposed to be bounded, so this can't happen. Therefore, all elements of G must have modulus 1. So G must be a subgroup of S¹. Therefore, any compact subgroup of ℂ\\{0} must be a closed subgroup of S¹. Since S¹ itself is compact, closed subgroups of S¹ are exactly the compact subgroups. So the question reduces to: Are there any infinite compact subgroups of S¹ other than S¹ itself?\n\nBut S¹ is a compact Lie group, and its closed subgroups are either finite cyclic groups or S¹ itself. Wait, yes, that's a standard result. The closed subgroups of S¹ are either finite cyclic groups consisting of the roots of unity of some fixed order, or the entire circle group. So if G is an infinite compact subgroup, it must be the entire S¹. Therefore, the answer should be yes: the unit circle is the only infinite compact subgroup.\n\nBut let me verify this step by step. Suppose G is an infinite compact subgroup of S¹. Since S¹ is compact, G is closed. So G is a closed infinite subgroup of S¹. The closed subgroups of S¹ are either finite cyclic groups or S¹. Therefore, if G is infinite, it must be S¹. Hence, the only infinite compact subgroup is S¹.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: consider the map from ℝ to S¹ given by θ ↦ e^{iθ}. This is a continuous homomorphism with kernel 2πℤ. The closed subgroups of S¹ correspond to closed subgroups of ℝ containing 2πℤ. The closed subgroups of ℝ are either discrete cyclic (isomorphic to ℤ) or all of ℝ. But since we have a quotient map, the closed subgroups of S¹ would correspond to closed subgroups of ℝ that contain 2πℤ. So if the subgroup of ℝ is generated by some α where α is a multiple of 2π/n for some n, then the image in S¹ is finite. If the subgroup is all of ℝ, then the image is S¹. So indeed, only finite cyclic or S¹.\n\nAlternatively, since S¹ is a compact connected abelian Lie group of dimension 1. Its closed subgroups must be Lie subgroups. The Lie subgroups of S¹ are either discrete (hence finite cyclic, since the group is compact) or the whole group. Hence, the only infinite closed subgroup is S¹ itself.\n\nAlternatively, suppose G is an infinite closed subgroup of S¹. Then G must have the circle as its identity component. Wait, but S¹ is connected, so its connected components are singleton sets. Wait, no. The identity component of a topological group is the connected component containing the identity. For S¹, it's the entire group since S¹ is connected. So if G is a closed subgroup, then its identity component is either trivial or the entire S¹. If G has identity component S¹, then G is S¹. If the identity component is trivial, then G is totally disconnected. But a compact totally disconnected group is profinite, i.e., a projective limit of finite groups. However, in the case of S¹, any closed subgroup is either finite or the whole group. Hence, an infinite closed subgroup must be the entire S¹.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the Pontryagin dual. The dual of S¹ is ℤ, and the dual of a closed subgroup would be a quotient of ℤ. The quotients of ℤ are either finite cyclic groups or ℤ itself. But the dual of ℤ is S¹, so this again shows that the closed subgroups of S¹ are either finite cyclic or S¹. Therefore, yes, only S¹ is the infinite one.\n\nAlternatively, suppose G is a compact infinite subgroup of ℂ\\{0}. As we saw, modulus 1. Then G is a compact subgroup of S¹. Suppose G ≠ S¹. Then G is a proper closed subgroup. But the proper closed subgroups of S¹ are finite. Hence, G must be finite. Therefore, by contrapositive, if G is infinite and compact, it must be S¹.\n\nTherefore, the answer is yes, G must equal S¹.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{S^1}"}

Hmm, let me think. Since both X and Y are standard normal, they each have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1. Their squares would follow a chi-squared distribution, right? Wait, but the sum of two independent chi-squared variables is also a chi-squared distribution. Specifically, if X and Y are standard normal, then X² + Y² follows a chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. Is that right?\n\nAlternatively, I remember that when dealing with sums of squares of normal variables, it relates to the Rayleigh distribution as well. Maybe because if you have two independent normals, their magnitude (sqrt(X² + Y²)) is Rayleigh distributed. But here we have the sum X² + Y², which is the square of the Rayleigh variable. So, maybe X² + Y² is an exponential distribution? Wait, the chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom is the same as an exponential distribution with parameter 1/2. Let me check that.\n\nThe chi-squared distribution with k degrees of freedom has the probability density function (PDF) given by f(x) = (1/(2^(k/2) Γ(k/2))) x^(k/2 - 1) e^(-x/2) for x > 0. So, for k=2, the PDF becomes f(x) = (1/(2 Γ(1))) x^(0) e^(-x/2). Since Γ(1) = 1, this simplifies to f(x) = (1/2) e^(-x/2). Wait, that's actually the PDF of an exponential distribution with λ = 1/2. Because the exponential PDF is λ e^(-λ x). So if we set λ = 1/2, then the PDF is (1/2) e^(-x/2), which matches. So yes, the sum X² + Y² ~ Exp(1/2). Therefore, the CDF would be P(X² + Y² < t) = 1 - e^(-t/2) for t ≥ 0.\n\nTherefore, substituting t = 1, we get P(X² + Y² < 1) = 1 - e^(-1/2). Calculating that, e^(-1/2) is approximately e^(-0.5) ≈ 0.6065, so 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935. So the probability is approximately 0.3935. Let me verify this result with another approach to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, since X and Y are standard normal, we can switch to polar coordinates. The joint PDF of X and Y is (1/(2π)) e^(-(x² + y²)/2). So to find P(X² + Y² < 1), we can integrate this joint PDF over the region x² + y² < 1. Switching to polar coordinates where x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ, the Jacobian determinant is r, so the integral becomes ∫₀^{2π} ∫₀^1 (1/(2π)) e^(-r²/2) r dr dθ. Integrating over θ first, we get 2π*(1/(2π)) = 1, so the integral simplifies to ∫₀^1 e^(-r²/2) r dr. Let me compute that integral. Let u = -r²/2, then du = -r dr. So the integral becomes ∫₀^{-1/2} -e^u du = ∫_{-1/2}^0 e^u du = e^u | from -1/2 to 0 = e^0 - e^{-1/2} = 1 - e^{-1/2}, which is the same as before. So that confirms the result. Therefore, the probability is indeed 1 - e^(-1/2) ≈ 1 - 0.6065 ≈ 0.3935. Rounded to four decimal places, that's 0.3935. Wait, but let me check if e^(-1/2) is indeed approximately 0.6065.\n\nCalculating e^(-0.5): I know that e^(-0.5) is approximately 1 / sqrt(e). Since sqrt(e) is approximately 1.6487, so 1 / 1.6487 ≈ 0.6065. Yes, that's correct. So 1 - 0.6065 is indeed 0.3935. Therefore, the probability is approximately 0.3935.\n\nAlternatively, if I use more precise value of e^(-0.5), let's compute it more accurately. Let me compute e^(-0.5). The value of e is approximately 2.718281828459045. So e^0.5 is sqrt(e) ≈ 1.6487212707001282. Therefore, e^(-0.5) = 1 / 1.6487212707001282 ≈ 0.6065306597126334. Therefore, 1 - 0.6065306597126334 ≈ 0.3934693402873666. So rounding this to four decimal places would give 0.3935. So yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the answer is 0.3935.\n\nBut wait, just to make sure I didn't miss anything here. The problem states that X and Y are independent standard normal variables. The sum of their squares is chi-squared with two degrees of freedom, which is equivalent to an exponential distribution with rate parameter 1/2. Therefore, the CDF at 1 is 1 - e^{-1/2}. Alternatively, converting to polar coordinates gives the same answer. Therefore, I think this is solid. So the answer should be 0.3935. Wait, but let me check the integral again.\n\nWait, when changing to polar coordinates, the integral over r from 0 to 1 of e^(-r²/2) * r dr. Let me integrate that again. Let u = -r²/2, so du = -r dr. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫ (from r=0 to r=1) e^u * (-du) = ∫ (from u=0 to u=-1/2) e^u du = e^u evaluated from 0 to -1/2, which is e^{-1/2} - e^{0} = e^{-1/2} - 1. Wait, hold on. Wait, if u = -r²/2, then when r=0, u=0. When r=1, u= -1/2. Then du = -r dr. Therefore, the integral ∫₀¹ e^(-r²/2) r dr = ∫₀^{-1/2} e^{u} (-du / r) * r. Wait, no. Let's do substitution properly. If u = -r²/2, then du = -r dr. Therefore, r dr = -du. So the integral becomes ∫₀¹ e^(-r²/2) r dr = ∫₀^{-1/2} e^{u} (-du) = ∫_{-1/2}^0 e^{u} du = e^{u} from -1/2 to 0 = e^0 - e^{-1/2} = 1 - e^{-1/2}. Yes, that's correct. So the integral is 1 - e^{-1/2}, so that's the probability. So that's the same answer as before. So that's correct. Therefore, the answer is 0.3935. So I think that's solid. So I should round that to four decimal places, so 0.3935. Therefore, the probability is \\boxed{0.3935}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{0.3935}"}
{"instruction": "Let X and Y be joint normal random variables with a common mean of 0, a common variance of 1, and a covariance of 1/2. Calculate the probability that \\( X + Y \\leq \\sqrt{3} \\).\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{{}}.", "output": "Okay, so I need to find the probability that X + Y is less than or equal to √3, where X and Y are joint normal variables with both means 0, variances 1, and covariance 1/2. Hmm, joint normal variables... that means their sum is also normally distributed, right? Let me recall. If two random variables are jointly normal, then any linear combination of them is also normally distributed. So X + Y should be a normal random variable.\n\nFirst, I need to find the parameters of this normal distribution for X + Y. The mean of X + Y would be the sum of the means. Since both X and Y have mean 0, the mean of X + Y is 0 + 0 = 0. \n\nNow, the variance. The variance of X + Y is Var(X) + Var(Y) + 2*Cov(X, Y). Since Var(X) and Var(Y) are both 1, that's 1 + 1 + 2*(1/2). Let me compute that: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. So the variance of X + Y is 3. Therefore, the standard deviation is sqrt(3). \n\nSo X + Y is a normal random variable with mean 0 and standard deviation sqrt(3). Therefore, the probability that X + Y <= sqrt(3) is the same as the probability that a standard normal variable Z is less than or equal to (sqrt(3) - 0)/sqrt(3). Wait, but if X + Y is N(0, 3), then to standardize it, we subtract the mean (which is 0) and divide by the standard deviation (sqrt(3)). So (X + Y)/sqrt(3) is standard normal.\n\nTherefore, P(X + Y <= sqrt(3)) = P( (X + Y)/sqrt(3) <= sqrt(3)/sqrt(3) ) = P(Z <= 1), where Z is standard normal. The probability that a standard normal variable is less than or equal to 1 is Φ(1), where Φ is the standard normal CDF. \n\nLooking up Φ(1) in standard normal tables, or recalling that Φ(1) is approximately 0.8413. But maybe they want an exact value? Wait, but Φ(1) can't be expressed in terms of elementary functions, so probably the answer is just Φ(1), which is 0.8413. However, maybe in the problem they want an exact expression or perhaps using the error function? Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes problems like this might want the answer in terms of the error function, but since Φ(1) is a standard value, it's commonly known. So I think the answer is Φ(1), which is approximately 0.8413. But since the problem asks to calculate the probability, maybe just leaving it as Φ(1) is acceptable, but perhaps they want the numerical value. Let me verify the steps once again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, check that X and Y are jointly normal. Yes, given. Then, X + Y is normal. Mean 0, variance 3. Then, the probability that X + Y <= sqrt(3) is equivalent to standardizing and getting Z <= 1. So yes, Φ(1). So I think that's correct. Therefore, the answer is Φ(1), which is approximately 0.8413. Since the problem says \"calculate,\" and given that it's a math problem, maybe they expect the answer in terms of the standard normal CDF, but usually in exams or problems like this, unless specified, you can just write Φ(1). Alternatively, if they want a numerical value, then 0.8413. Wait, let me check with another approach just to be safe.\n\nAlternatively, since Cov(X, Y) = 1/2, the correlation coefficient ρ = Cov(X, Y)/(σ_X σ_Y) = (1/2)/(1*1) = 1/2. So the joint distribution is bivariate normal with mean vector (0,0), variance 1 each, and correlation 1/2. Then, X + Y ~ N(0, Var(X + Y)) as before. So Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) + 2Cov(X, Y) = 1 + 1 + 2*(1/2) = 3. So same result. Therefore, same conclusion. So the answer is Φ(1). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the student to use the joint PDF and integrate, but since they are joint normal, linear combinations are normal, so that's a theorem we can use. So unless there's a trick here, I think the answer is Φ(1). So the probability is Φ(1). Since the problem is about calculating it, perhaps they just want the boxed answer as \\boxed{\\Phi(1)}, but maybe they need a numerical value. Let me check with my knowledge. Φ(1) is approximately 0.8413, so if I write that, I can box 0.8413, but maybe they want the exact value in terms of sqrt(3). Wait, no, Φ(1) is standard. Let me check if sqrt(3) is involved in some other way.\n\nWait, the original variable is X + Y <= sqrt(3). Since X + Y has variance 3, standard deviation sqrt(3). So sqrt(3) is one standard deviation above the mean (which is zero). So in standard units, that's 1. So yes, the probability is Φ(1). So that's the answer. So Φ(1) is approximately 0.8413. Since the problem says \"calculate,\" but in many probability courses, Φ(1) is considered a calculated value, especially since it's a standard result. So maybe I can write both, but likely they want the numerical value. Let me check the standard normal table: Φ(1) is indeed approximately 0.8413. Therefore, the answer is approximately 0.8413.\n\nAlternatively, in some textbooks, they might use the error function, where Φ(z) = 1/2 + 1/2 erf(z/√2). So for z=1, Φ(1) = 1/2 + 1/2 erf(1/√2). But unless the problem asks for it in terms of erf, probably just 0.8413 is fine. Therefore, I think the answer is 0.8413, which is Φ(1). So I should box that.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe probability that \\( X + Y \\leq \\sqrt{3} \\) is \\boxed{0.8413}."}

I need to compute the integral \\( \\int_{\\gamma(1;1/2)} \\frac{\\cos(\\pi z)}{z^{2}-3z+2} \\, dz \\) using Cauchy's integral formula. The circle is centered at 1 with radius 1/2. Hmm, first, maybe I should factor the denominator to see if there are any singularities inside the contour.\n\nThe denominator is \\( z^2 - 3z + 2 \\). Let's factor that. Let me find the roots. The quadratic equation: \\( z = [3 ± sqrt(9 - 8)] / 2 = [3 ± 1]/2. So z = 2 and z = 1. Therefore, the denominator factors as (z - 1)(z - 2). So the integrand is \\( \\frac{\\cos(\\pi z)}{(z - 1)(z - 2)} \\). \n\nNow, the contour is centered at 1 with radius 1/2. So the circle is from 1 - 1/2 = 0.5 to 1 + 1/2 = 1.5. The singularities of the integrand are at z = 1 and z = 2. Since the radius is 1/2, the circle goes up to 1.5. The point z = 2 is at 2, which is outside the circle because the circle's maximum is 1.5. So z = 2 is outside the contour. What about z = 1? The center is at 1, radius 1/2. So z = 1 is the center of the contour. So z = 1 is inside the contour. Therefore, the integrand has a singularity at z = 1 inside the contour and z = 2 outside, so we only need to consider the residue at z = 1.\n\nBut wait, to use Cauchy's integral formula, maybe I need to write the integrand in a form that matches the formula. The Cauchy integral formula says that if f is analytic inside and on a contour γ, and a is inside γ, then \\( \\frac{1}{2\\pi i} \\int_{\\gamma} \\frac{f(z)}{z - a} dz = f(a) \\). So here, the integrand is \\( \\frac{\\cos(\\pi z)}{(z - 1)(z - 2)} \\). Let me try to write this as \\( \\frac{\\cos(\\pi z)/(z - 2)}{z - 1} \\). Then, if I let f(z) = \\( \\frac{\\cos(\\pi z)}{z - 2} \\), then the integrand is f(z)/(z - 1), so by Cauchy's integral formula, the integral should be 2πi * f(1). Let's check if that's valid.\n\nFirst, f(z) = \\( \\frac{\\cos(\\pi z)}{z - 2} \\). Is f(z) analytic inside and on the contour γ(1;1/2)? The only singularity of f(z) would be at z = 2, but z = 2 is outside the contour, as we saw earlier. So f(z) is analytic inside and on the contour. Therefore, by Cauchy's integral formula, the integral is 2πi * f(1). \n\nCompute f(1): \\( \\frac{\\cos(\\pi * 1)}{1 - 2} = \\frac{\\cos(\\pi)}{-1} = \\frac{-1}{-1} = 1 \\). Therefore, the integral is 2πi * 1 = 2πi. Wait, is that all? Let me just verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using residues. The integrand has a simple pole at z = 1. The residue there is the limit as z approaches 1 of (z - 1) * \\( \\frac{\\cos(\\pi z)}{(z - 1)(z - 2)} \\) = limit as z→1 of \\( \\frac{\\cos(\\pi z)}{z - 2} \\). Which is \\( \\frac{\\cos(\\pi)}{-1} = 1 \\). So the residue is 1, then the integral is 2πi * residue = 2πi. So that's consistent. Therefore, the answer should be 2πi.\n\nWait, but maybe I should double-check the radius. The contour is centered at 1 with radius 1/2. So the distance from 1 to 2 is 1, which is greater than the radius 1/2, so 2 is definitely outside. The only singularity inside is z=1. So yes, the calculation seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, could there be another approach? For example, partial fractions? Let's see. The integrand can be written as \\( \\frac{\\cos(\\pi z)}{(z - 1)(z - 2)} = \\frac{A}{z - 1} + \\frac{B}{z - 2} \\). Let me compute A and B. Multiply both sides by (z - 1)(z - 2):\n\ncos(πz) = A(z - 2) + B(z - 1). Let z = 1: cos(π) = A(-1) + B(0) → -1 = -A → A = 1. Let z = 2: cos(2π) = A(0) + B(1) → 1 = B → B = 1. Therefore, the integrand is \\( \\frac{1}{z - 1} + \\frac{1}{z - 2} \\). Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, cos(πz) is equal to A(z - 2) + B(z - 1). If we set z = 1, cos(π) = A(-1) → A = 1. If z = 2, cos(2π) = B(1) → B = 1. Therefore, indeed, cos(πz) = (z - 2) + (z - 1) = 2z - 3. Wait, that can't be. Wait, cos(πz) is equal to A(z - 2) + B(z - 1). But substituting A = 1 and B = 1, we get cos(πz) = (z - 2) + (z - 1) = 2z - 3. But cos(πz) is not equal to 2z - 3. That's a contradiction. So this approach must be wrong. Wait, what's happening here?\n\nOh, maybe partial fractions can't be applied directly here because the numerator is cos(πz), which is not a polynomial. Partial fractions works for rational functions where numerator and denominator are polynomials. Here, the numerator is a transcendental function, so partial fractions isn't applicable in the same way. So my mistake was trying to use partial fractions on a non-polynomial numerator. So that method doesn't work here. Therefore, my initial approach using Cauchy's integral formula was correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps split the integrand as \\( \\frac{\\cos(\\pi z)}{(z - 1)(z - 2)} \\), and since only z = 1 is inside the contour, the integral is equal to 2πi times the residue at z = 1, which is the limit as z approaches 1 of (z - 1) times the integrand, which is cos(πz)/(z - 2). Evaluated at z = 1 gives cos(π)/ (-1) = (-1)/(-1) = 1. So residue is 1, integral is 2πi. So same answer.\n\nAlternatively, using Cauchy's integral formula directly as I first did. So the answer is 2πi. Let me check with another perspective. Suppose I consider the function f(z) = cos(π z)/(z - 2). Since f(z) is analytic inside and on γ(1;1/2), as z = 2 is outside, then the integral over γ of f(z)/(z - 1) dz is 2πi f(1), which is 2πi * [cos(π)/ (-1)] = 2πi * 1. So yes, same result.\n\nTherefore, the integral should be 2πi. But let me confirm once more. The radius is 1/2, so the contour doesn't enclose z = 2. The only enclosed singularity is at z = 1. The residue at z = 1 is 1, so integral is 2πi. Seems correct. So I think that's the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the integral is \\boxed{2\\pi i}."}
{"instruction": "Find \\( \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} - \\cdots - \\frac{1}{2n}\\right) \\).\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{{}}.", "output": "Okay, so I need to find the limit as n approaches infinity of the series: 1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + ... - 1/(2n). Hmm, that looks familiar. It's an alternating series, right? Let me think. The terms are decreasing in absolute value and approaching zero, so by the alternating series test, the series should converge. But here, the question is about the limit as n approaches infinity of the partial sum up to 2n terms. So essentially, it's asking for the sum of the infinite alternating harmonic series.\n\nWait, the alternating harmonic series is known to converge to ln(2), right? Let me recall. The Taylor series for ln(1 + x) is x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - x^4/4 + ... for |x| ≤ 1 and x ≠ -1. If we plug in x = 1, we get ln(2) = 1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + ... which is exactly the series we have here. So, does that mean the limit is ln(2)? But wait, in the problem statement, the series is up to -1/(2n). So if n approaches infinity, then 2n also approaches infinity. Therefore, the partial sum S_{2n} of the alternating harmonic series approaches ln(2). Therefore, the limit should be ln(2). Let me confirm that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express the partial sum as H_{2n}^{(1)} where H_n^{(1)} is the nth harmonic number, but since it's alternating, maybe split it into even and odd terms. Let me try that.\n\nLet's write out the partial sum S_{2n} = 1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + ... - 1/(2n). Let's group the terms in pairs: (1 - 1/2) + (1/3 - 1/4) + ... + (1/(2n-1) - 1/(2n)). Each pair is 1/(2k-1) - 1/(2k) for k from 1 to n. Let's compute each pair: 1/(2k-1) - 1/(2k) = [2k - (2k -1)] / [ (2k -1)(2k) ] = 1 / [ (2k -1)(2k) ].\n\nSo S_{2n} = sum_{k=1}^n [1/( (2k -1)(2k) )]. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps write it as sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-1)^{k+1}/k. Which is the same as the partial sum of the alternating harmonic series. So as n approaches infinity, that partial sum approaches ln(2).\n\nAlternatively, consider that the partial sum S_{2n} of the alternating harmonic series can be related to the harmonic numbers. Recall that the harmonic number H_n = sum_{k=1}^n 1/k. Then, the alternating harmonic series partial sum can be written as H_{2n} - H_n. Wait, let me check that.\n\nWait, S_{2n} = sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-1)^{k+1}/k = sum_{k=1}^{2n} 1/k - 2 sum_{k=1}^n 1/(2k) = H_{2n} - sum_{k=1}^n 1/k = H_{2n} - H_n. So yes, S_{2n} = H_{2n} - H_n. Then, we can use the approximation for harmonic numbers. Recall that H_n ≈ ln(n) + γ + 1/(2n) - 1/(12n^2) + ..., where γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. So H_{2n} ≈ ln(2n) + γ + 1/(4n) - 1/(48n^2) + ..., and H_n ≈ ln(n) + γ + 1/(2n) - 1/(12n^2) + .... Then, subtracting, H_{2n} - H_n ≈ ln(2n) - ln(n) + [1/(4n) - 1/(2n)] + higher order terms. The ln(2n) - ln(n) is ln(2). The terms 1/(4n) - 1/(2n) is -1/(4n), and the rest are higher order terms. So as n approaches infinity, these terms go to zero, so the limit is ln(2). Therefore, the limit is indeed ln(2).\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to use the integral representation. The sum S_{2n} = sum_{k=1}^{2n} (-1)^{k+1}/k. We can relate this to the integral of a function. For example, we know that ln(2) = ∫₀¹ 1/(1 + x) dx. Let me check:\n\n∫₀¹ 1/(1 + x) dx = ln(1 + x) from 0 to 1 = ln(2) - ln(1) = ln(2). Also, the integral can be expressed as a series. Let's expand 1/(1 + x) as a power series. For |x| < 1, 1/(1 + x) = 1 - x + x² - x³ + x⁴ - ... So integrating term by term from 0 to 1 gives ∫₀¹ 1/(1 + x) dx = sum_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k ∫₀¹ x^k dx = sum_{k=0}^∞ (-1)^k / (k + 1) = sum_{m=1}^∞ (-1)^{m-1}/m, which is exactly the alternating harmonic series. Therefore, the sum converges to ln(2), so the limit as n approaches infinity of S_{2n} is ln(2).\n\nAlternatively, if I didn't recall that, maybe I can use the definition of the Riemann sum. But perhaps that's complicating things. Another way is to use the fact that the partial sums of the alternating harmonic series approach ln(2), with the error term decreasing as 1/n. So as n tends to infinity, the partial sum S_{2n} tends to ln(2). Therefore, the answer should be ln(2).\n\nWait, but let me check with specific values. For example, when n = 1, S_2 = 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. When n = 2, S_4 = 1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 = 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 = 1/2 + 1/12 = 7/12 ≈ 0.5833. For n = 3, S_6 = 7/12 + 1/5 - 1/6 = 7/12 + 1/30 ≈ 0.5833 + 0.0333 ≈ 0.6166. As n increases, it's approaching ln(2) ≈ 0.6931. Wait, but those partial sums are approaching ln(2) from below. Wait, but if n approaches infinity, 2n also approaches infinity. So S_{2n} is approaching ln(2). However, the partial sums of the alternating harmonic series alternate around ln(2), with the even partial sums S_{2n} increasing and approaching ln(2) from below, and the odd partial sums S_{2n+1} decreasing and approaching ln(2) from above. So indeed, the limit as n approaches infinity of S_{2n} is ln(2).\n\nTherefore, the answer should be ln(2), so in boxed form, \\boxed{\\ln 2}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\ln 2}"}
{"instruction": "Evaluate the limit: \\[ \\lim_{x\\to 0} \\frac{1}{x^3}\\int_{0}^{x} \\sin^{2}(3t)\\,dt \\] without explicitly finding the antiderivative.\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{{}}.", "output": "Okay, so I need to evaluate the limit as x approaches 0 of [1/x³ times the integral from 0 to x of sin²(3t) dt]. Hmm, and the problem says not to explicitly find the antiderivative. Alright, so maybe I can use some approximation or series expansion? Let me think.\n\nFirst, when I see a limit involving an integral divided by x³ as x approaches 0, that makes me think of using L'Hospital's Rule or maybe Taylor series expansions. Since the integral from 0 to x of sin²(3t) dt is going to be a function whose behavior near 0 we need to understand. \n\nLet me recall that for small t, sin(3t) is approximately 3t, right? Because sin(z) ≈ z when z is near 0. So sin²(3t) would then be approximately (3t)² = 9t². So maybe the integral from 0 to x of sin²(3t) dt is approximately the integral from 0 to x of 9t² dt. Let me compute that integral. The integral of 9t² from 0 to x is 9*(x³/3 - 0) = 3x³. So then, the original expression would be approximately (1/x³)*(3x³) = 3. So the limit would be 3? But wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. If I let F(x) be the integral from 0 to x of sin²(3t) dt, then the limit becomes lim_{x→0} F(x)/x³. If I can evaluate this limit, which is of the form 0/0, since F(0) = 0 and the denominator x³ is also 0. So applying L'Hospital's Rule here. \n\nYes, that's a good approach. So applying L’Hospital’s Rule, we take the derivative of the numerator and denominator. The derivative of F(x) is sin²(3x) by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, and the derivative of x³ is 3x². So the limit becomes lim_{x→0} sin²(3x)/(3x²). Then, that's (1/3) lim_{x→0} [sin(3x)/x]^2. Since sin(3x)/x is 3*sin(3x)/(3x), and we know that lim_{z→0} sin(z)/z = 1. So substituting z = 3x, as x approaches 0, z approaches 0. Therefore, lim_{x→0} sin(3x)/x = lim_{z→0} 3 sin(z)/z = 3*1 = 3. Therefore, [sin(3x)/x]^2 approaches 9, so multiplying by 1/3 gives 3. So the limit is 3. But wait, so both methods give me the same answer. So that seems good. \n\nBut let me confirm. Alternatively, could I expand sin²(3t) using a power series? Let's see. The identity sin²(u) = (1 - cos(2u))/2. So sin²(3t) = (1 - cos(6t))/2. Then, integrating term by term. The integral from 0 to x of [1 - cos(6t)]/2 dt = (1/2)[ ∫0^x 1 dt - ∫0^x cos(6t) dt ] = (1/2)[ x - (sin(6x)/6) ]. Then, plugging into the original limit: [1/x³]*(1/2)(x - sin(6x)/6) = (1/(2x³))(x - sin(6x)/6) = (1/(2x³))(x - (6x - (6x)^3/6 + ... )/6). Let me expand sin(6x) as a Taylor series. sin(6x) = 6x - (6x)^3/6 + (6x)^5/120 - ... So sin(6x)/6 = x - (6x)^3/(6*6) + higher terms = x - (36x^3)/36 + ... = x - x³ + ... Therefore, x - sin(6x)/6 = x - (x - x³ + ...) = x³ - ... So the numerator is x³ - higher order terms. Therefore, (1/(2x³))(x³ - ... ) = 1/2 - ... So as x approaches 0, the limit is 1/2. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous result. Wait, so this is a problem. Hmm. So according to this method, the limit is 1/2, but according to the previous methods, it's 3. So now I must have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's check step by step. First, sin²(3t) = (1 - cos(6t))/2. Correct. Then integrating from 0 to x: ∫0^x [1 - cos(6t)]/2 dt = (1/2)[ ∫0^x 1 dt - ∫0^x cos(6t) dt ] = (1/2)[x - (sin(6t)/6) from 0 to x] = (1/2)[x - (sin(6x)/6 - 0)] = (1/2)(x - sin(6x)/6). Then, so the integral is (x/2 - sin(6x)/12). Therefore, when we plug into the original limit: [1/x³](x/2 - sin(6x)/12) = (x/2 - sin(6x)/12)/x³ = (1/(2x²) - sin(6x)/(12x³)).\n\nWait, so that's (1/(2x²) - sin(6x)/(12x³)). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Let me write it as [1/(2x²) - (1/12) sin(6x)/x³]. Now, to evaluate the limit as x approaches 0. Let's compute each term. The first term is 1/(2x²), which goes to infinity as x approaches 0. The second term is (1/12) sin(6x)/x³. sin(6x) ≈ 6x - (6x)^3/6 + ... so sin(6x)/x³ ≈ (6x)/x³ - (216x³)/6x³ + ... = 6/x² - 36 + ... So multiplying by 1/12 gives (6/x²)/12 - 36/12 + ... = (1/(2x²)) - 3 + ... So the entire expression becomes [1/(2x²) - (1/(2x²) - 3 + ...)] = 1/(2x²) -1/(2x²) + 3 - ... = 3 + ... So the limit is 3. Wait, so when I did the expansion, the leading terms cancel, and the next term gives 3. So the limit is 3. So that matches the previous results.\n\nAh, so my initial mistake was probably miscalculating the expansion. So, this method also gives 3, which is consistent. Therefore, the correct answer is 3.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: using the Mean Value Theorem for integrals. The integral from 0 to x of sin²(3t) dt equals x*sin²(3c) for some c between 0 and x. Then, the expression becomes [x*sin²(3c)]/x³ = sin²(3c)/x². Then, as x approaches 0, c approaches 0 as well, so sin²(3c) ≈ 9c². Therefore, sin²(3c)/x² ≈ 9c²/x². But since c is between 0 and x, c = kx for some 0 < k < 1. Therefore, 9(kx)²/x² = 9k². Then, as x approaches 0, k is some constant between 0 and 1, but we don't know its exact value, so this approach might not be helpful here. Hmm, but perhaps if we use higher-order terms. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe we can use a Taylor expansion with remainder.\n\nAlternatively, use the expansion of sin²(3t). As I mentioned, sin²(3t) = (1 - cos(6t))/2. Then, expand cos(6t) as 1 - (6t)^2/2 + (6t)^4/24 - ... So, 1 - cos(6t) = (6t)^2/2 - (6t)^4/24 + ... So, sin²(3t) = [ (36t²)/2 - (1296 t^4)/24 + ... ] / 2 = [18t² - 54t^4 + ... ] / 2 = 9t² - 27t^4 + ... Then, integrating from 0 to x: ∫0^x (9t² - 27t^4 + ...) dt = 9*(x³/3) - 27*(x^5/5) + ... = 3x³ - (27/5)x^5 + ... Then, dividing by x³: 3 - (27/5)x² + ... So as x approaches 0, the limit is 3. Therefore, confirming again that the limit is 3.\n\nSo multiple methods give me 3, so I think that's the correct answer. Therefore, the limit is 3.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{3}"}
{"instruction": "Evaluate the integral \\( \\int_0^1 \\frac{\\sqrt{s}}{\\sqrt{1-s}} \\text{d}s \\).\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{{}}.", "output": "Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral from 0 to 1 of sqrt(s)/sqrt(1-s) ds. Hmm, let's see. I remember integrals involving square roots often relate to beta or gamma functions, but maybe there's a substitution I can use here. Let me start by thinking about substitution.\n\nThe integrand is sqrt(s)/sqrt(1 - s). That looks a bit like a Beta function integral, which is usually of the form s^{c-1}(1 - s)^{d-1} ds from 0 to 1. Comparing that, here we have s^{1/2}*(1 - s)^{-1/2}. So if c - 1 = 1/2, then c = 3/2, and d - 1 = -1/2, so d = 1/2. The Beta function B(c, d) is equal to Gamma(c)Gamma(d)/Gamma(c + d). So if I recall correctly, B(3/2, 1/2) would be Gamma(3/2)Gamma(1/2)/Gamma(2). And Gamma(1/2) is sqrt(pi), Gamma(3/2) is (1/2)sqrt(pi), and Gamma(2) is 1! So putting that together, Gamma(3/2)Gamma(1/2)/Gamma(2) = (1/2 sqrt(pi)) * sqrt(pi) / 1! = (1/2)*pi. So the Beta function B(3/2, 1/2) is pi/2. Therefore, the integral should be pi/2. Wait, but let me verify this by actually computing the integral through substitution to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use substitution. Let me let t = sqrt(s/(1 - s)). Then s = t^2/(1 + t^2). Let me compute that. If t = sqrt(s/(1 - s)), then t^2 = s/(1 - s), so s = t^2*(1 - s). Therefore, s = t^2 - s t^2. Bring the s t^2 term to the left: s + s t^2 = t^2. Factor out s: s(1 + t^2) = t^2. Therefore, s = t^2/(1 + t^2). Then, what's ds in terms of dt? Let's compute ds/dt. s = t^2/(1 + t^2). So ds/dt = [2t(1 + t^2) - t^2*2t]/(1 + t^2)^2 = [2t + 2t^3 - 2t^3]/(1 + t^2)^2 = 2t/(1 + t^2)^2. So ds = 2t/(1 + t^2)^2 dt.\n\nNow, substitute into the integral. The original integral is from s=0 to s=1. When s=0, t = sqrt(0/(1 - 0)) = 0. When s=1, t approaches sqrt(1/0) which is infinity. So the limits become t from 0 to infinity. The integrand is sqrt(s)/sqrt(1 - s) = t (from the substitution t = sqrt(s/(1 - s))). So substituting, the integral becomes integral from t=0 to t=infty of t * [2t/(1 + t^2)^2] dt. Simplify that: 2 integral from 0 to infty of t^2/(1 + t^2)^2 dt.\n\nHmm, that integral. Let me see. Let me make a substitution for this integral. Let u = t, dv = t/(1 + t^2)^2 dt. Wait, maybe integration by parts. Alternatively, maybe use substitution. Let me set u = t^2 + 1, then du = 2t dt, but not sure. Alternatively, trigonometric substitution. Let t = tan theta. Then t = tan theta, dt = sec^2 theta d theta. Then 1 + t^2 = sec^2 theta. Then the integral becomes 2 integral from theta=0 to theta=pi/2 of [tan^2 theta / sec^4 theta] * sec^2 theta d theta. Simplify: 2 integral tan^2 theta / sec^2 theta d theta. Since tan^2 theta = sec^2 theta - 1, so substitute that: 2 integral (sec^2 theta - 1)/sec^2 theta d theta = 2 integral (1 - cos^2 theta) d theta. Wait, because 1/sec^2 theta is cos^2 theta. Wait, no: (sec^2 theta - 1)/sec^2 theta = 1 - 1/sec^2 theta = 1 - cos^2 theta = sin^2 theta. So it's 2 integral sin^2 theta d theta from 0 to pi/2. Then, integral of sin^2 theta d theta is (theta - sin theta cos theta)/2 evaluated from 0 to pi/2. So plug in pi/2: (pi/2 - 0)/2 = pi/4. Plug in 0: (0 - 0)/2 = 0. So the integral is 2*(pi/4) = pi/2. So that matches the Beta function result. So the integral is indeed pi/2. So that seems solid.\n\nAlternatively, another substitution. Let me try u = 1 - s. Then du = -ds. When s=0, u=1, s=1, u=0. So the integral becomes integral from u=1 to u=0 of sqrt(1 - u)/sqrt(u) (-du) = integral from 0 to 1 of sqrt(1 - u)/sqrt(u) du. Wait, that's the same as the original integral but with s replaced by u. So that shows the integral is equal to itself, which doesn't help much. But perhaps adding them together? Wait, if I call the original integral I, then after substitution I = integral sqrt(s)/sqrt(1 - s) ds from 0 to1. Then substitution u =1 - s gives I = integral sqrt(1 - u)/sqrt(u) du from 0 to1. So adding the two expressions: 2I = integral [sqrt(s)/sqrt(1 - s) + sqrt(1 - s)/sqrt(s)] ds from 0 to1. Let's combine the terms: [sqrt(s)/sqrt(1 - s) + sqrt(1 - s)/sqrt(s)] = [s + (1 - s)] / sqrt(s(1 - s)) ) = 1 / sqrt(s(1 - s)). So 2I = integral 1 / sqrt(s(1 - s)) ds from 0 to1. That's another Beta function integral, specifically B(1/2, 1/2) which is Gamma(1/2)^2 / Gamma(1) = pi / 1 = pi. So 2I = pi, so I = pi/2. That's a nice method too. So whether through substitution, recognizing Beta function, or even using symmetry, we get pi/2.\n\nAlternatively, another substitution: let s = sin^2 theta. Then sqrt(s) = sin theta, sqrt(1 - s) = cos theta. Then ds = 2 sin theta cos theta d theta. When s=0, theta=0; s=1, theta=pi/2. Substitute into the integral: integral from 0 to pi/2 of [sin theta / cos theta] * 2 sin theta cos theta d theta. Simplify: 2 integral sin^2 theta d theta from 0 to pi/2. Which again is 2*(pi/4) = pi/2. So same result.\n\nSo all methods lead to pi/2. Therefore, the integral is pi/2. Therefore, I can be confident that the answer is pi over two.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the integral is \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}}."}

What well-known topological space does this adjunction space resemble?\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{{}}.", "output": "Okay, so I need to figure out what the adjunction space X sqcup_f Y looks like, where X is the closed unit disk D², A is its boundary S¹, Y is just a single point {1}, and the map f: S¹ → Y is the constant map that sends everything to 1. Hmm, adjunction spaces... I remember that they're formed by gluing two spaces together along a subspace using a continuous map. Let me recall the definition.\n\nAn adjunction space X ∪_f Y is formed by taking the disjoint union of X and Y and then quotienting by the equivalence relation that identifies each point a in A (which is a subset of X) with its image f(a) in Y. So in this case, we have the disk D² and a point Y = {1}. The map f is collapsing the entire boundary S¹ of the disk to the single point 1. So, essentially, we're taking the disk and identifying all the points on its boundary to a single point. \n\nWait, isn't that the definition of the quotient space D²/S¹? Because when you take a space and quotient a subspace to a point, you just collapse that subspace to a single point. So D²/S¹ should be homeomorphic to S², the 2-sphere. But let me make sure. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, the adjunction space here is formed by taking D² and {1}, and gluing the boundary S¹ of D² to the point 1 via the constant map. So every point in S¹ is identified with 1. So in the adjunction space, all the points on the boundary of the disk become one single point, and the interior of the disk remains as it is. So topologically, the interior of the disk is an open disk, which is homeomorphic to ℝ², and then we have a single point that all the boundary points are collapsed to. So the resulting space is the open disk plus a single point, which compactifies it. \n\nWait, but the open disk is not compact, but when you add a point at infinity (so to speak), you get a compact space. In this case, adding the point where all the boundary is collapsed. So the open disk plus a point at the \"boundary\" makes it into a sphere. Let me visualize this. Imagine the disk D². If I collapse its boundary to a point, then the resulting space is like taking the disk and pulling the entire boundary into a single point. So imagine the disk being stretched such that the edge is all brought together into one point. This should result in a sphere. \n\nTo confirm, let's recall that the 2-sphere can be constructed as a quotient space of the disk by collapsing the boundary to a point. That's a standard example in topology. So D²/S¹ ≈ S². Therefore, the adjunction space X ∪_f Y here is homeomorphic to the 2-sphere. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is via the one-point compactification. The open disk is homeomorphic to the plane, which is not compact. The one-point compactification of the plane is the sphere. So by taking the disk (which is already compact, but when you collapse its boundary, the interior is like the plane, and collapsing the boundary to a point is like adding a point at infinity, hence the one-point compactification, which is S²). \n\nWait, but the disk D² is already compact, right? So why is its quotient also compact? Well, the quotient of a compact space is compact. So D²/S¹ is compact. And since the quotient is also Hausdorff (because the original space is Hausdorff and the quotient map is closed?), then it must be a compact Hausdorff space. The 2-sphere is a compact Hausdorff space. \n\nAnother angle: Consider the map from D² to S² via the quotient map. You can think of it as taking the disk and mapping it onto the southern hemisphere of S², with the boundary of the disk (the equator) all mapped to the north pole. Wait, no. Actually, the usual quotient map from D² to S² is by collapsing the boundary to a single point, which becomes the north pole, and the rest of the disk is homeomorphic to the sphere minus the north pole. So yeah, that's the standard quotient map. \n\nAlternatively, using the stereographic projection. If you take the closed disk and apply the inverse of the stereographic projection from the north pole, you wrap the disk around the sphere, with the boundary of the disk going to the north pole. So that's another way to see that D²/S¹ is S². \n\nAlternatively, think of the disk as being a cell, and when you attach a 2-cell to a point via the constant map, you're essentially just capping off the boundary with a point. But wait, attaching a 2-cell to a point would require a map from S¹ to the point, which is the constant map, and the result is the 2-cell with its boundary collapsed, which is S². \n\nAlternatively, think of the adjunction space as the pushout of the inclusion map A ↪ X and the map f: A → Y. In this case, since Y is a point, the pushout is the space obtained by gluing X to Y by identifying each point in A with the point in Y. Since all points in A are identified, we get X/A, which is D²/S¹ ≈ S². \n\nTherefore, the adjunction space in question is homeomorphic to the 2-sphere. So the well-known topological space it resembles is the 2-sphere, S².\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe adjunction space \\( X \\sqcup_{f} Y \\) is homeomorphic to the 2-sphere, so the well-known topological space is \\boxed{S^2}."}

Hmm, I remember that integrals involving e^(-x²) are related to the Gaussian function, and the standard Gaussian integral is ∫ e^(-x²) dx from -∞ to ∞, which equals √π. But this one has an x² term multiplied in. Maybe I can use integration by parts? Let me recall how that works. Integration by parts formula is ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du. \n\nSo, let me choose u and dv. If I let u = x, then du = dx. But then dv would be x e^(-½ x²) dx. Wait, but if u is x, then dv needs to be x e^(-½ x²) dx. Hmm, but integrating dv would be tricky. Maybe another choice? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use substitution. The exponent is -½ x², so if I let t = x / √2, then the exponent becomes -t². But there's an x² term. Let me try that substitution. Let t = x / √2, so x = t√2, and dx = √2 dt. Then the integral becomes ∫ (t√2)^2 e^(-t²) √2 dt. Let's compute that. (t√2)^2 is 2 t², so the integral is 2 t² e^(-t²) √2 dt. Combine constants: 2 * √2 = 2^(3/2). So integral becomes 2^(3/2) ∫ t² e^(-t²) dt from -∞ to ∞. \n\nBut wait, ∫ t² e^(-t²) dt from -∞ to ∞ is a standard integral. I think it's related to the Gaussian integral as well. The integral of x² e^{-x²} dx from -∞ to ∞ is (√π)/2. Wait, actually, let me check. The standard integral ∫_{-∞}^∞ x² e^{-a x²} dx is (√(π) (1)/(2a^(3/2)) ) for a > 0. Wait, maybe I need to recall the formula properly. \n\nAlternatively, since we know that ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{-a x²} dx = √(π/a). Then, if we take the derivative with respect to a, we can get the integral involving x². Let me try that. Let’s consider I(a) = ∫_{-∞}^∞ e^{-a x²} dx = √(π/a). Then, take derivative of both sides with respect to a: I’(a) = d/da √(π/a) = -√(π)/(2 a^(3/2)). On the other hand, I’(a) = ∫_{-∞}^∞ (-x²) e^{-a x²} dx. Therefore, ∫_{-∞}^∞ x² e^{-a x²} dx = -I’(a) = √(π)/(2 a^(3/2)). \n\nSo, in our case, when we did substitution t = x / √2, the integral became 2^(3/2) * ∫ t² e^{-t²} dt. Here, a = 1, so ∫ t² e^{-t²} dt is √π/(2 *1^(3/2)) ) = √π/2. Therefore, multiplying by 2^(3/2): 2^(3/2) * √π / 2 = 2^(1/2) * √π = √(2π). Hmm, wait, so is that the answer? √(2π). Let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, let me go back to the original integral: ∫_{-∞}^∞ x² e^{-½ x²} dx. Let me set a = 1/2. Then using the formula ∫ x² e^{-a x²} dx = √π/(2 a^(3/2)). So substituting a = 1/2: √π / (2*(1/2)^(3/2)) ) = √pi / (2*(1/(2√2))) ) = √pi / (1/(√2)) ) = √pi * √2 = √(2pi). So that seems to match. Therefore, the integral is √(2π). Wait, but let me check my substitution again to be sure.\n\nOriginal substitution: t = x / √2, so x = t√2, dx = √2 dt. Then, x² e^{-½ x²} dx becomes (2 t²) e^{- t²} * √2 dt. So the integral is 2 * √2 ∫ t² e^{-t²} dt. 2 * √2 is 2^(3/2). The integral of t² e^{-t²} from -infty to infty is (√pi)/2. So total integral is 2^(3/2) * (√pi)/2 = 2^(1/2) * √pi = √(2pi). Yes, so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, integration by parts. Let me try that approach as another method. Let u = x, dv = x e^{-½ x²} dx. Then du = dx, and v = ∫ x e^{-½ x²} dx. Let me compute v. Let’s set w = -½ x², dw = -x dx. So, ∫ x e^{-½ x²} dx = -∫ e^w dw = -e^w + C = -e^{-½ x²} + C. So v = -e^{-½ x²}. Then integration by parts gives uv - ∫v du: [ -x e^{-½ x²} ] from -infty to infty minus ∫ -e^{-½ x²} dx. \n\nNow, evaluating the boundary term: as x approaches ±infty, e^{-½ x²} goes to zero, and x multiplied by that also goes to zero. So the boundary term is 0. Then we have - ∫ -e^{-½ x²} dx = ∫ e^{-½ x²} dx. The integral of e^{-½ x²} dx from -infty to infty is √(2pi). Because the standard Gaussian integral ∫ e^{-x²} dx = √pi, so if we have e^{-a x²}, it's √(pi/a). Here a = 1/2, so √(pi / (1/2)) = √(2pi). So the integral becomes √(2pi). \n\nTherefore, using integration by parts also gives the same result, √(2pi). So both methods confirm that the integral is √(2π). Therefore, I think that's the answer. \n\nWait, but let me check once more. Suppose we didn't know those formulas. Let me recall that for the Gaussian integral, the n-th moment can be given by (n-1)!! σ^n for even n, where σ is the standard deviation. But in this case, the integral is ∫ x² e^{-½ x²} dx. Comparing to the standard normal distribution, which is (1/√(2π)) e^{-½ x²}, so the integral ∫ x² (1/√(2π)) e^{-½ x²} dx is the variance, which is 1. Therefore, ∫ x² e^{-½ x²} dx = √(2π) * 1 = √(2π). Yes, that matches as well. \n\nTherefore, all methods lead to the conclusion that the value of the integral is √(2π). So I think that's the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe value of the integral is \\boxed{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}."}

Hmm, let's start by recalling some linear algebra concepts.\n\nFirst, rank of a matrix is the dimension of its column space. So, since A has rank 5, its columns span a 5-dimensional space. Similarly, B has rank 5, so its columns also span a 5-dimensional space. But A is 5x7, so it has 7 columns, each in R^5, and since the rank is 5, those columns are linearly independent? Wait, no, actually, the rank is the dimension of the column space, so even though there are 7 columns, they can't all be linearly independent in R^5. Wait, A is 5x7, rank 5, which means the column space is all of R^5, right? Because the maximum rank for a 5x7 matrix is 5, so that's full rank. Similarly, B is 7x5 with rank 5, so its column space is a 5-dimensional subspace of R^7.\n\nNow, AB = I_5. That's interesting. So the product of A and B is the identity matrix. So B is a right inverse of A, and A is a left inverse of B. But since A is 5x7 and B is 7x5, their product BA is a 7x7 matrix. The question is to find the rank and nullity of BA.\n\nI remember that for any matrix product, the rank satisfies rank(AB) ≤ min{rank(A), rank(B)}. But here, AB is I_5, which has rank 5. So that's consistent, since both A and B have rank 5. Now, BA is a 7x7 matrix. What can we say about its rank?\n\nI think there's a result that says if AB is invertible, then BA is also invertible, but wait, BA is a 7x7 matrix and AB is 5x5. In our case, AB is invertible (it's the identity matrix). But BA is a larger matrix. So maybe BA has some eigenvalues that are 1 and 0? Wait, let me think.\n\nAlternatively, there's a property that rank(BA) ≤ min{rank(B), rank(A)}. Since both A and B have rank 5, then rank(BA) ≤ 5. But AB = I_5, which is rank 5, so maybe BA has rank 5 as well? But BA is a 7x7 matrix. So if its rank is 5, then its nullity is 7 - 5 = 2. So the answer would be (5, 2). But let me verify this more carefully.\n\nAnother approach: consider the matrix BA. Since B is 7x5 and A is 5x7, BA is a 7x7 matrix. Now, let's analyze the null space of BA. Suppose x is in the null space of BA, so BAx = 0. Then, A(BAx) = A0 = 0. But A(BAx) = (AB)Ax = I_5 Ax = Ax. Therefore, Ax = 0. So if BAx = 0, then Ax = 0. But A has rank 5, so the null space of A is 7 - 5 = 2 dimensional. Wait, A is 5x7, rank 5, so nullity(A) = 7 - 5 = 2. So the null space of A is 2-dimensional.\n\nBut wait, if BAx = 0 implies Ax = 0, then the null space of BA is equal to the null space of A. Wait, no. Let's see. If BAx = 0, then Ax is in the null space of B. But AB = I_5, so B has full column rank? Wait, B is 7x5 with rank 5, so columns are linearly independent. Therefore, the null space of B is just {0} in R^5. Because B is a 7x5 matrix with rank 5, so its nullity is 5 - 5 = 0. So if BAx = 0, then Ax is in null(B) which is {0}, so Ax = 0. Therefore, null space of BA is the same as null space of A, which is 2-dimensional. Therefore, the nullity of BA is 2, so the rank is 7 - 2 = 5. Hence, (5, 2).\n\nWait, that seems to check out. Let me recap to make sure. If x is in null(BA), then BAx = 0. Multiplying both sides by A gives ABAx = 0, but ABAx = A(BAx) = A0 = 0. But ABAx = (AB)Ax = I_5 Ax = Ax. Therefore, Ax = 0. So null(BA) is contained in null(A). Conversely, if x is in null(A), then Ax = 0, so BAx = B0 = 0, so x is in null(BA). Therefore, null(BA) = null(A). Since nullity(A) is 2, then nullity(BA) is 2. Therefore, rank(BA) = 7 - 2 = 5. So the rank is 5 and the nullity is 2. Therefore, the answer is (5, 2).\n\nAlternatively, I can think of BA as a linear transformation from R^7 to R^7. Since AB = I_5, then B is a right inverse of A, and A is a left inverse of B. The matrix BA acts as the identity on the image of B. Because if we take a vector y in R^5, then BA(By) = B(AB)y = B(I_5)y = By. So BA acts as the identity on the image of B. Since B has rank 5, the image of B is a 5-dimensional subspace of R^7. Therefore, BA is the identity on a 5-dimensional subspace. Therefore, BA has eigenvalues 1 with multiplicity 5, and the rest 0. Therefore, the rank is 5 (number of non-zero eigenvalues) and the nullity is 7 - 5 = 2.\n\nAnother way, using Sylvester's rank inequality: rank(A) + rank(B) - 7 ≤ rank(AB) ≤ min{rank(A), rank(B)}. But here AB is rank 5, so Sylvester's inequality gives 5 + 5 -7 ≤ rank(AB), which is 3 ≤ rank(AB). But AB is actually 5, so that's fine. Not sure if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, since rank(BA) ≥ rank(ABA) = rank(A(BA)) ≥ rank(AB) + rank(A) - 5 (by some formula?), maybe not. Alternatively, using the fact that rank(BA) = rank(B) - dim(null(A) ∩ image(B)). Hmm, but I might not remember that formula correctly.\n\nBut since we already showed that null(BA) = null(A), which has dimension 2, so nullity(BA) = 2, so rank(BA) = 7 - 2 = 5. That seems straightforward.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (5, 2). So I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{(5, 2)}"}
{"instruction": "Determine the number of bijections from the set of positive integers to itself.\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{{}}.", "output": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many bijections there are from the set of positive integers to itself. Hmm, let's start by recalling what a bijection is. A bijection is a function that is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). That means every element in the codomain is mapped to by exactly one element in the domain. Since we're dealing with the set of positive integers, which is an infinite set, this might be a bit trickier than finite sets where the number of bijections is just the factorial of the size of the set.\n\nFirst, let me think about finite sets for a moment. If we have a finite set with n elements, the number of bijections (permutations) is n!. That makes sense because for the first element, you can map it to any of the n elements, the next one to n-1 elements, and so on. But when the set is infinite, like the positive integers, things are different. The concept of factorial doesn't directly apply here, and the size of the set is countably infinite.\n\nSo, how do we count the number of bijections in this case? In set theory, the cardinality of the set of bijections (or permutations) of a countably infinite set is a well-known result, but I need to recall or derive it. Let me start by considering the cardinality of the set of all functions from the positive integers to themselves. The set of all functions from a countable set to another countable set has cardinality equal to the cardinality of the continuum, which is 2^ℵ₀ (beth-one). But bijections are a subset of all functions, so their cardinality must be at most 2^ℵ₀. But is it exactly 2^ℵ₀ or less?\n\nWait, another thought. The set of bijections on a countably infinite set is actually of cardinality 2^ℵ₀. How do we see that? Let's try to construct different bijections. For example, consider swapping pairs of elements. If we can find a way to encode an arbitrary binary sequence into a bijection, then that would give us 2^ℵ₀ bijections. Alternatively, think about permutations as rearrangements. Since the set is infinite, we can permute the elements in infinitely many ways, but we need to check if the number is the same as the number of real numbers or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the set of bijections has the same cardinality as the real numbers. Since the cardinality of the continuum is 2^ℵ₀, which is equal to the cardinality of the real numbers. So, if we can show there's a bijection between the set of bijections on positive integers and the real numbers, then the cardinality would be 2^ℵ₀. Alternatively, maybe it's higher? Wait, but the set of all functions from ℕ to ℕ is 2^ℵ₀, so subsets of that can't have higher cardinality. So, the set of bijections must be at most 2^ℵ₀.\n\nBut is it exactly 2^ℵ₀? To confirm this, we can show that there are at least 2^ℵ₀ bijections. One way to do this is to encode each subset of ℕ into a permutation. Wait, but subsets of ℕ are 2^ℵ₀ in number. However, not every subset corresponds directly to a unique permutation. Maybe another approach: consider splitting the positive integers into pairs, like (1,2), (3,4), (5,6), etc. For each pair, we can decide to swap the elements or leave them as they are. Each such choice is independent for each pair, and since there are countably infinitely many pairs, the number of such permutations would be 2^ℵ₀, since the product of countably many copies of 2 is 2^ℵ₀. Hence, this gives us 2^ℵ₀ distinct bijections. Therefore, the cardinality of the set of bijections must be exactly 2^ℵ₀.\n\nAlternatively, another way to see this is by realizing that the symmetric group on a countably infinite set has cardinality 2^ℵ₀. The symmetric group S_Ω for a countably infinite set Ω is indeed of cardinality continuum. This is a result in set theory and group theory.\n\nBut let me verify this more carefully. Suppose we want to construct an injection from the set of binary sequences (which has cardinality 2^ℵ₀) into the set of bijections. Let's take an infinite binary sequence, say s = s₁s₂s₃..., where each sᵢ is 0 or 1. Then, we can define a permutation π_s as follows: for each i, if sᵢ = 1, swap the elements 2i-1 and 2i; if sᵢ = 0, leave them as they are. Since each swap is a transposition and they operate on disjoint pairs, the overall result is a bijection. Each different binary sequence gives a different permutation because the action on each pair is uniquely determined by the corresponding bit. Hence, this is an injective map from the set of binary sequences to the set of bijections. Therefore, the cardinality of the set of bijections is at least 2^ℵ₀.\n\nOn the other hand, the set of all functions from ℕ to ℕ has cardinality ℵ₀^ℵ₀, which is equal to 2^ℵ₀. Since the set of bijections is a subset of all functions, its cardinality cannot exceed 2^ℵ₀. Therefore, by the Cantor-Bernstein theorem, since we have injections both ways (though trivially the inclusion is an injection from bijections to functions), but actually we have that the cardinality of bijections is exactly 2^ℵ₀.\n\nWait, but hold on. Is ℵ₀^ℵ₀ equal to 2^ℵ₀? Let me recall. Yes, in cardinal arithmetic, 2^ℵ₀ ≤ ℵ₀^ℵ₀ ≤ (2^ℵ₀)^ℵ₀ = 2^(ℵ₀*ℵ₀) = 2^ℵ₀. So, ℵ₀^ℵ₀ = 2^ℵ₀. Therefore, the cardinality of all functions from ℕ to ℕ is 2^ℵ₀, and the set of bijections is a subset of this with the same cardinality. So, that's the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the number of bijections from the set of positive integers to itself is 2^ℵ₀, which is the cardinality of the continuum. In terms of notation, this is often written as 𝔠, but since the problem asks for the number, probably expecting the answer in the box as \\boxed{2^{\\aleph_0}} or \\boxed{\\mathfrak{c}} depending on convention. However, in set theory, 2^{\\aleph_0} is the standard way to denote the cardinality of the continuum.\n\nBut wait, let me check if there's another perspective. Maybe someone could argue that the number of permutations is ℵ₁ or something else, but no, ℵ₁ is the first uncountable ordinal, which is different. The cardinality of the continuum is 2^{ℵ₀}, which is not provably equal to ℵ₁ in ZFC due to the independence of the continuum hypothesis. Therefore, the correct answer should be 2^{ℵ₀}, which is the cardinality of the set of bijections on the positive integers.\n\nTherefore, after all this reasoning, I conclude that the number of bijections is 2^ℵ₀.\n\n**Final Answer**\nThe number of bijections from the set of positive integers to itself is \\boxed{2^{\\aleph_0}}."}

And I can't use L'Hôpital's rule. Hmm, let's see. First, when x approaches π/2, sin x approaches 1, right? So ln sin x would approach ln 1, which is 0. And cos x approaches 0, so cos squared x also approaches 0. So this is a 0/0 indeterminate form. Normally, that's when you might use L'Hôpital's, but the problem says not to. So I need another approach.\n\nMaybe I can rewrite the expression in a way that makes the limit easier to compute. Let me think. If I let t = π/2 - x, then as x approaches π/2, t approaches 0. That substitution might simplify things. Let's try that.\n\nLet t = π/2 - x. Then when x → π/2, t → 0. So sin x becomes sin(π/2 - t) = cos t. And cos x becomes cos(π/2 - t) = sin t. So substituting, the numerator becomes ln cos t, and the denominator becomes (sin t)^2. So the limit becomes the limit as t approaches 0 of (ln cos t) divided by (sin t)^2.\n\nHmm, that's a bit simpler. Now, I can maybe use Taylor series expansions for ln cos t and sin t around t = 0. Let me recall the expansions.\n\nFirst, cos t ≈ 1 - t²/2 + t^4/24 - ... for small t. So ln cos t would be ln(1 - t²/2 + higher order terms). And the Taylor series for ln(1 + u) around u = 0 is u - u²/2 + u³/3 - ..., so if u is -t²/2 + higher terms, then ln cos t ≈ (-t²/2) - ( (-t²/2)^2 ) / 2 + ... which would be -t²/2 - t^4/8 + ... So the leading term is -t²/2.\n\nOn the denominator, (sin t)^2 is approximately (t - t³/6 + ...)^2 ≈ t² - t^4/3 + ... So the denominator is t² + higher order terms.\n\nSo substituting these into the limit, numerator ≈ -t²/2, denominator ≈ t². So the ratio would approximate (-t²/2) / t² = -1/2. Therefore, the limit as t approaches 0 is -1/2. Hence, the original limit is -1/2.\n\nWait, but let me check if this substitution is correct. Because when I let t = π/2 - x, then as x approaches π/2 from below, t approaches 0 from above, and from above, t approaches 0 from the right. But sin t and cos t are even functions, so the expansion would be the same regardless of the direction. So maybe it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the standard limits. For example, as t approaches 0, ln(cos t) ~ -t²/2, and (sin t)^2 ~ t². Therefore, the ratio is approximately (-t²/2)/t² = -1/2, so the limit is -1/2. That seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, another method: multiply numerator and denominator by something to make it more manageable. Hmm, but not sure. Alternatively, write ln(sin x) as ln(1 - cos^2 x)^{1/2}? Wait, no, sin x = sqrt(1 - cos^2 x), but that's not helpful here. Wait, when x approaches π/2, cos x approaches 0, so maybe set u = cos x, so as x approaches π/2, u approaches 0. Then sin x = sqrt(1 - u^2). Then the expression becomes ln(sqrt(1 - u^2)) / u^2 = (1/2) ln(1 - u^2) / u^2. Then, as u approaches 0, ln(1 - u^2) ≈ -u^2 - u^4/2 - ... So (1/2)(-u^2) / u^2 = -1/2. So same result.\n\nSo this substitution also gives the same answer. Therefore, the limit is -1/2. That seems consistent.\n\nAlternatively, using the property that ln(1 + a) ~ a when a is small. Here, sin x approaches 1, so ln sin x = ln(1 + (sin x - 1)) ≈ sin x - 1 when x approaches π/2. Wait, but sin x - 1 approaches 0, so maybe that's a way. Let me check.\n\nSo sin x = 1 - (π/2 - x)^2 / 2 + ... as x approaches π/2. Wait, is that the expansion? Let's verify. Let t = π/2 - x, then sin x = cos t ≈ 1 - t²/2. So sin x - 1 ≈ -t²/2. Therefore, ln sin x = ln(1 - t²/2) ≈ -t²/2 - ( - t²/2 )^2 / 2 + ... ≈ -t²/2 - t^4 / 8 + ... So again, leading term -t²/2. So substituting back into the original limit, which is (ln sin x) / cos^2 x. But cos^2 x = sin^2 t = t² - ... So same as before. Therefore, leading term -t²/2 divided by t² is -1/2.\n\nSo regardless of substitution, the result is the same. Therefore, the limit is -1/2. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{-\\dfrac{1}{2}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{-\\dfrac{1}{2}}"}
{"instruction": "Find the limit: \\[ \\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\left(\\frac{x}{x-1}\\right)^{2x+1} \\]\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{{}}.", "output": "Alright, so I need to find the limit as x approaches infinity of (x/(x-1))^(2x+1). Hmm, okay. Let me think. Limits involving exponents can sometimes be tricky. Maybe I can rewrite this expression in a form that's easier to handle. \n\nFirst, the base of the exponent is (x/(x-1)). As x approaches infinity, both the numerator and denominator are going to be very large, right? So, x/(x-1) should be approaching 1 because the difference between x and x-1 becomes negligible as x gets really big. So the base is approaching 1, and the exponent is 2x+1, which is approaching infinity. So this is a 1^infinity indeterminate form. I remember that these types of limits can often be evaluated using the exponential function and natural logarithms. Maybe I can use the property that lim_{x→a} f(x)^{g(x)} = e^{lim_{x→a} (f(x)-1)*g(x)} when f(x) approaches 1 and g(x) approaches infinity. Wait, is that the right formula?\n\nAlternatively, another method is to take the natural logarithm of the expression, evaluate the limit, and then exponentiate the result. Let me try that. Let me set L = lim_{x→∞} (x/(x-1))^{2x+1}. Then, take the natural log of both sides: ln L = lim_{x→∞} (2x+1) * ln(x/(x-1)). If I can compute this limit, then I can exponentiate the result to find L.\n\nOkay, let's compute ln L = lim_{x→∞} (2x + 1) * ln(x/(x-1)). Let's simplify the logarithm first. ln(x/(x-1)) = ln(x) - ln(x-1). So, ln L = lim_{x→∞} (2x +1)(ln x - ln(x -1)). Hmm, maybe I can rewrite ln x - ln(x -1) as ln(x/(x-1)) again, but I just did that. Alternatively, perhaps approximate the difference ln x - ln(x -1). Let's see. Let me consider a substitution. Let h = 1/(x -1). Then as x approaches infinity, h approaches 0. Wait, maybe another substitution. Let me set t = x -1. Then, as x approaches infinity, t also approaches infinity. So, substituting t = x -1, then x = t +1, so ln x - ln(x -1) = ln(t +1) - ln t = ln((t +1)/t) = ln(1 + 1/t). So, ln L = lim_{t→∞} (2(t +1) +1) * ln(1 + 1/t) = lim_{t→∞} (2t +3) * ln(1 + 1/t). \n\nOkay, so now we have ln L = lim_{t→∞} (2t +3) * ln(1 + 1/t). Maybe I can use the Taylor series expansion of ln(1 + y) around y = 0. Since as t approaches infinity, 1/t approaches 0, so ln(1 + 1/t) ≈ 1/t - 1/(2t^2) + ... So, ln(1 + 1/t) ≈ 1/t for large t. Therefore, (2t +3) * (1/t - 1/(2t^2)) ≈ (2t +3)(1/t) - (2t +3)/(2t^2). Let's compute that. First term: (2t +3)/t = 2 + 3/t. Second term: -(2t +3)/(2t^2) = -2t/(2t^2) -3/(2t^2) = -1/t - 3/(2t^2). So altogether, the expansion becomes 2 + 3/t -1/t - 3/(2t^2) = 2 + 2/t - 3/(2t^2). As t approaches infinity, the terms with 1/t and 1/t^2 go to 0, so the limit of ln L is 2. Therefore, ln L = 2, so L = e^2. \n\nWait, let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, maybe use L’Hospital’s Rule. Let's see. Let me write the expression (2t +3) * ln(1 + 1/t) as [ln(1 + 1/t)] / [1/(2t +3)]. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps write the entire expression as ln(1 + 1/t) divided by 1/(2t +3). Wait, but as t approaches infinity, ln(1 + 1/t) ~ 1/t - 1/(2t^2) + ..., so 1/(2t +3) ~ 1/(2t). So, maybe not. Alternatively, let me set u = 1/t. Then as t approaches infinity, u approaches 0. So, substitute u = 1/t. Then ln L = lim_{u→0} (2*(1/u -1) +3) * ln(1 + u). Wait, that might be messy. Wait, t = 1/u, so x = t +1 = 1/u +1. Wait, maybe not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the expression (2t +3) * ln(1 + 1/t). Let me factor out t from the first term. So, (2t +3) = t*(2 + 3/t). Then, ln(1 + 1/t) ~ 1/t - 1/(2t^2) + ... So, t*(2 + 3/t)*(1/t - 1/(2t^2)) = (2 + 3/t)*(1 - 1/(2t)) = 2*(1 -1/(2t)) + 3/t*(1 -1/(2t)) = 2 - 1/t + 3/t - 3/(2t^2). Which simplifies to 2 + 2/t - 3/(2t^2). Again, as t approaches infinity, the terms with 1/t and 1/t^2 vanish, so the limit is 2. Therefore, ln L = 2, so L = e^2. That seems consistent.\n\nWait, but let me try another approach to verify. Let me recall that lim_{x→∞} (1 + a/x)^x = e^a. Maybe manipulate the original expression into such a form. So, starting with (x/(x -1))^(2x +1). Let's write x/(x -1) as 1 + 1/(x -1). So, (1 + 1/(x -1))^(2x +1). Let me make a substitution. Let n = x -1, so as x approaches infinity, n also approaches infinity. Then the expression becomes (1 + 1/n)^{2(n +1) +1} = (1 + 1/n)^{2n +3}. Then, split the exponent: (1 + 1/n)^{2n} * (1 + 1/n)^3. As n approaches infinity, (1 + 1/n)^n approaches e, so (1 + 1/n)^{2n} approaches e^2. And (1 + 1/n)^3 approaches 1. Therefore, the entire expression approaches e^2 *1 = e^2. So, that's another way to see it, and the answer is e squared. \n\nSo both methods give the same result, e^2. Therefore, the limit is e squared. Let me check with a calculator or maybe plug in a large x value. Let's take x = 1000. Then (1000/999)^{2001}. Compute ln(1000/999) = ln(1 + 1/999) ≈ 1/999 - 1/(2*999^2). So, multiply by 2001: 2001*(1/999 - 1/(2*999^2)) ≈ (2001/999) - (2001)/(2*999^2). 2001/999 is approximately 2.002002, and the second term is about (2001)/(2*998001) ≈ 2001/(1996002) ≈ 0.001. So, total is approx 2.002002 - 0.001 ≈ 2.001. Exponentiating gives e^{2.001} ≈ e^2 * e^{0.001} ≈ e^2*(1 +0.001) ≈ 7.389 *1.001 ≈ 7.396. Now, compute (1000/999)^{2001}. Let's compute 1000/999 = 1.001001..., and raise it to 2001. Using a calculator, 1.001001^2001 ≈ e^(2001*0.001001) ≈ e^(2.002). Which is about e^2*e^0.002 ≈ 7.389*1.002 ≈ 7.403. Which is close to e^2. So, that seems to check out. \n\nTherefore, the limit is indeed e squared. So, the answer is e², which can be written as \\boxed{e^2}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{e^2}"}
